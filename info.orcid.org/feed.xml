										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2014, Denmark took a significant step towards enhancing research visibility and integrity by launching its national consortium, dedicated to integrating ORCID into the country’s research infrastructure. In 2014, together with celebrating its decade of existence, it expanded to 11 members, including now universities, hospitals, and research organizations.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-trust-through-verified-research-information"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Building trust through verified research information</span></h2>


<p>With nearly 1.5 million data entries (employment, education, works, and personal identifiers) contributed to ORCID records, the Danish consortium plays a key role in ensuring the credibility of researcher profiles. These verified affiliations, works, and personal identifier details act as <span style="font-style: italic;">Trust Markers</span>, signaling that the information is accurate and institutionally endorsed. Trust Markers help mitigate misinformation and contribute to strengthening trust throughout the entire research ecosystem, making ORCID profiles a reliable source for research assessment and collaboration. <br><br><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfrXBwuHSzRWGUFEzD4QdKoWbpRofKHkdioxMgoUsdEx3x2v8UKqWxNKBAFrot2fi-P94uquNXCjk7t6WfnoRHkEbrxXBapqXrq-YQYDsM6QQ7nxRuFv0lOCzzFUm-bXZvQeWmZ?key=bDJWR4_Ru3R4pdclI7FfjMKe" alt=""><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd9xbsklUc99rq-hyTRLpBx_Dhqh7v_jRNtNC5QS_6rVK-BuY5LQac1nP5Xk-8WVI-hl3RzpjZlzwPN-aGiiU5i5cKaCme-LHffwWvC9qCCnpqzmlk9mnTQUTrjd3D_Kff1yxrzjA?key=bDJWR4_Ru3R4pdclI7FfjMKe" alt=""><br>Figure 1.

<p>Denmark’s research institutions share a common research information system (CRIS), Pure, making ORCID integration highly effective. This has enabled researchers to automatically link their ORCID profiles with their institutions, ensuring their records stay updated with minimal effort. <br><br>Led by Aalborg University, the consortium continues to refine this integration, making it easier for researchers to manage their academic footprint.<br>Together with their CRIS, some members host an institutional journal platform built on Open Journal System (OJS), which allows authors, contributors and reviewers to easily connect their articles and peer review activities to ORCID records.</p>

<p>As persistent identifiers (PIDs) gain traction, ORCID is being recognized by the Danish community as a key component in transparent and fair research assessment frameworks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc3Vfzyg6MVnvN_kNmrWbtZjXyJAxTsrKjfMZ3Off6SFkhE26llMXV4OLlozkSFMqg63FC-lmMpPimJ8wwLjZTr-H6RTlXLpWg7P-FgC2vo_Us7s6EghRBBMXGIWsLI3msQIswVxA?key=bDJWR4_Ru3R4pdclI7FfjMKe" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Figure 2. Aalborg University Research Indicator, where ORCID and PIDs are key components in the Open Science Part. Source:  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.54337/aau524581687" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://doi.org/10.54337/aau524581687</a></span> </p>



<p>Denmark is actively exploring how Trust Markers and PIDs can contribute to more reliable evaluation practices, drawing inspiration from international initiatives like PID Network Deutschland and Australia’s PID efforts.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-the-danish-consortium"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What’s next for the Danish Consortium?</span></h2>


<p>For the Danish community, the focus remains on strengthening integrations, expanding engagement, and ensuring researchers and institutions maximize the benefits of ORCID. Annual consortium meetings continue to drive discussions and collaboration around ORCID advocacy, interoperability, and data contributions.</p>



<p>The Consortium aims to remain actively involved in the global implementation of ORCID and continue supporting work around persistent identifiers (PIDs) more broadly. Maintaining this global perspective is crucial for ensuring Denmark stays aligned with international best practices. There have been ongoing discussions about how it could contribute to developing a national Danish PID strategy. The Consortium invites stakeholders across Denmark to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:orcid@aub.aau.dk">join this conversation</a></span>&nbsp;and collaborate in shaping a strong, coordinated approach to PIDs for research and innovation.</p>

CSTI has identified that lack of accurate scholar data in a consistent format—notably the name ambiguity—has led to poor quality databases of research publications and other scholarly works. The project will help provide an overarching perspective that can speak to stakeholders with different interests. It will yield a holistic view or understanding of context, conditions, and contingencies to inform assessments, situate interests, and facilitate decision-making.</p>

<p>The project by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://xploreopen.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">XploreOpen</a></span>&nbsp;will build an ORCID Community of Practice through bilingual training, workshops, and online resources tailored to the needs of researchers, administrators, and librarians. By training 200 individuals and establishing a network of 100 ORCID advocates, it will foster sustained adoption, empowering researchers to connect globally. Indirectly, the project could impact over 10,000 individuals as trained advocates disseminate knowledge and integrate ORCID into institutional workflows. This project fosters equitable ORCID adoption in underrepresented research communities, including Higher Education Institutions, Research and Development organizations, and regional institutions. The initiative targets a 25 percent adoption increase and builds capacity, strengthens infrastructure, and promotes open research in Pakistan.</p>

<p>This will be the first step towards the eventual goal of VIVO becoming a ORCID Certified Service Provider and will move VIVO’s ORCID support from passive (users can currently only link their ORCID ID to their VIVO profile) to active. The project also includes a translation of the integration documents into Spanish and Ukrainian and offers instructional webinars with live interpretation. Enabling globally distributed VIVO instances to push researcher data to ORCID will help build a better open data ecosystem of researchers&#8217; works, maximizing visibility and impact of researchers from the target regions.</p>

<p><span>At the end of each quarter we’ll revisit past events and provide our community with a chance to catch up on anything they might have missed, including links to the replays. The first quarter of this year produced two events, one in-person and one online. Stay tuned to our </span><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/events/" data-wpel-link="internal">events calendar</a></span><span> as more events are listed throughout the year. </span></p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consortia-lead-workshop"><span style="font-weight:700">Consortia Lead Workshop</span></h2>


<p><span>In February we hosted our biannual consortia lead workshop in Munich, Germany. We brought together 18 consortia leads, eight board members, and ORCID staff for two days to connect with one another, discuss the successes and challenges within consortia, and collaborate on solutions. </span></p>



<p><span>We thank Ludwig Maximilian Universität München for hosting us and look forward to meeting in person again in September 2025, with appreciation to the South African consortium, TENET, for hosting! </span><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/strengthening-collaboration-highlights-from-our-orcid-consortia-lead-workshop-in-munich/" data-wpel-link="internal">Read the blog</a></span><span> for more details and photos from this exciting in-person workshop. </span></p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-research-integrity-featuring-signals"><span style="font-weight:700">Research Integrity featuring Signals</span></h2>


<p><span>In March we hosted Signals for our latest webinar in the </span><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/11478851" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Research Integrity series</a></span><span>, which is designed to highlight thought leaders and experts in research, cyber security, and more to share their insights about trends and emerging solutions.</span></p>



<p><span>Signals is a research evaluation platform that combines insights from the scholarly record metadata with expert knowledge from sleuths, researchers, and editors. In this session, Signals co-founders Tiago Barros and Elliott Lumb discussed how they restore trust in research by delivering transparent, actionable evaluations of publications and manuscripts to help the scholarly community make informed decisions on the value and credibility of research. </span></p>

<p>Now in the third full year of our current <a href="https://orcid.figshare.com/articles/online_resource/From_Vision_to_Value_ORCID_s_2022_2025_Strategic_Plan/16687207/1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>From Vision to Value: ORCID’s 2022–2025 Strategic Plan</em></a>, we continue to build momentum toward our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">vision</a> of a world where all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions across disciplines, borders, and time. The progress we’ve made in 2024 across our five strategic areas — Increasing Value to Members, Increasing Value to Researchers, Increasing Global Participation, Upholding Trust and Integrity, and Improving Staff Experience — demonstrates the growing value of ORCID as an essential piece of global research infrastructure.</p>

<p><em>Current reflections on our blog, </em><a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-we-wont-be-sold" data-wpel-link="internal"><em>ORCID: We won’t be sold</em></a></p>



<p>Nine years ago, Laure Haak, the founding Executive Director of ORCID, outlined the steps taken by the founding team to ensure ORCID’s sustainability into the future. Reflecting on this blog post nine years later, we appreciate how the sturdiness of the framework established early in ORCID’s history has allowed us to keep pace with an ever-evolving world, while keeping true to our values and our principles.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="735" height="414" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rapidlychangingworld.png?resize=735%2C414&#038;ssl=1" alt="A blue and green graphic that has the green circle ORCID icon, and a quote by ORCID executive director Chris Shillum that reads, &quot;The best way to persist in a world that is rapidly changing is by staying true to the principles that earned us the trust of our community in the first place.&quot;" class="wp-image-32206" style="width:456px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rapidlychangingworld.png?w=735&amp;ssl=1 735w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rapidlychangingworld.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rapidlychangingworld.png?resize=285%2C160&amp;ssl=1 285w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2025, we find ourselves in a situation where the political climate around the world is rapidly changing the landscape of research and academic funding, and its effects, while still uncertain, are being felt widely across different regions and stakeholder groups. Although ORCID is formally constituted as a US non-profit, we operate very much as an international community-driven organization, with a <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-board/" data-wpel-link="internal">governance body</a> drawn from our global community, and indeed a globally based team with staff members on every continent apart from Antartica. Over 50% of our team is based in Europe, and of ORCID&#8217;s 1,412 member organizations, over three quarters are based outside of the United States.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we provide updates on the topics covered in Laure’s 2016 blog post, reflecting on the progress we’ve made in the intervening nine years, while remaining true to the earlier vision.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>ORCID was founded to deliver a specific goal: every researcher who wants to have a unique lifelong identifier should have one and be free to use it in their daily work. Every time a researcher, scholar, or other knowledge worker shares their ideas, they should be able to connect their identifier to their ideas. Every expression of knowledge — in whatever form it takes — should be connected to the people who created it and the places and spaces where the ideas were developed. This is summed up by our <a href="https://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid/mission" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">vision</a> of a world where all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions and affiliations across disciplines, borders, and time.</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true">2025 Update: still true</h3>


<p>We consider this sentiment to be our north star, and we constantly work to expand the &#8220;expressions of knowledge&#8221; supported by the ORCID record. The fifth of our ten <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/#founding-principles" data-wpel-link="internal">Founding Principles</a> states that “Researchers will be able to create, edit, and maintain an ORCID identifier and record free of charge.” Not only are we committed to ensuring that researchers are free to use their ORCID record in their daily work, but we also strive to make it ever easier for them to do so.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-earning-your-trust">Earning Your Trust</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-0">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>For this vision to become reality, the research community needs to adopt and implement ORCID identifiers. And for that to happen, ORCID must fulfill our charter as an organization worthy of the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/03//orcid-trust" data-wpel-link="internal">trust and respect</a> of the community. We need to remain open — both in terms of access to the identifiers and associated data, and in terms of continuance of operations.</em></p>



<p><em>Trust starts with transparency and consistency. We make ourselves accountable to those who use and support ORCID activities through our principles, business model, governance, how we handle disputes, and how we involve the community.</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-and-we-re-rising-to-meet-evolving-threats">2025 Update: still true, and we’re rising to meet evolving threats</h3>


<p>Though the issues surrounding the ideas of trust have changed dramatically since we launched our Trust Program in 2016, the way that ORCID thinks about individual control, accountability via public scrutiny, and integrity via strict provenance tracking has changed very little. ORCID has worked to earn and keep the trust of our community by remaining true to our founding principles and our core values of openness, trust and inclusivity, and by ensuring that our technology is reliable and safeguards our users’ privacy. But while trust takes a long time to earn, we know it can be lost much more quickly, and we must constantly strive to maintain the trust we’ve earned by monitoring and managing key technological, reputational, and financial risks.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The <a href="https://info.orcid.org/documentation/integration-guide/working-with-bulk-data/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Public Data File</a> is currently hosted by Figshare, an independent third party, on servers that reside in Ireland and Germany.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-principles">ORCID Principles</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-1">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>We are grounded by <a href="https://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid/principles" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">10 principles</a> that guide our work. These principles emphasize our commitment to respecting the privacy and data sharing needs of our users and being a reliable, inclusive, and open partner with the research community. <a href="https://info.orcid.org/04//importance-opt" data-wpel-link="internal">Our users control</a> whether their data are shared and with whom; ORCID makes all <a href="https://orcid.org/content/orcid-public-data-file" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">data made public by users</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Creative Commons ‘zero’ license</a>, a vital feature for anyone seeking to re-use and build upon data from the registry. The registry itself can be accessed using an open API, and is built using open source code. As a non-profit organization we do not profit from the information entrusted to us by researchers and scholars.</em></p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="737" height="413" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/principlesarepromises.png?resize=737%2C413&#038;ssl=1" alt="A purple graphic that has the green circle ORCID icon, and a quote by ORCID executive director Chris Shillum that reads: &quot;ORCID believes that principles are promises, and they are made to be kept – period.&quot;" class="wp-image-32203" style="width:426px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/principlesarepromises.png?w=737&amp;ssl=1 737w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/principlesarepromises.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/principlesarepromises.png?resize=285%2C160&amp;ssl=1 285w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></figure></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-0">2025 Update: still true</h3>


<p>ORCID believes that principles are promises, and they are made to be kept — period. No changes have been made to any of our 10 founding principles — we view them as a cast-iron promise to our community about how we will conduct ourselves, as true now and into the future as they were when ORCID was first established. We invite you to familiarize yourself with our principles and hold us to account if we ever waiver from our commitment to them.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-our-business-model">Our Business Model</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-2">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>ORCID is a <a href="https://orcid.org/about/membership" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">membership organization</a>. Our goal is to be 100% supported by membership dues and, thanks to community support, we expect to get there in 2017. While we are building our membership base, we have received support in the form of long term <a href="https://orcid.org/about/community/sponsors" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">community loans</a> (due to be repaid starting in 2021), subawards from the <a href="https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/11100120/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Andrew W.

Sloan Foundation</a> and the Leona M and Harry B Helmsley Trust. As a membership organization, we are by design responsive to our community. Our members drive and control our future growth.</em></p>



<p><em>By design, we are also independent and cannot be sold. ORCID Inc. is a not-for-profit <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-section-501-c-3-organizations" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">501(c)3</a> organization registered in the United States. As such, we are subject to laws of the US Internal Revenue Service that specify that we cannot be purchased or otherwise managed by a commercial entity.</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-1">2025 Update: still true</h3>


<p>Although it took a couple of years longer than expected, in 2019, we achieved full financial sustainability, with our operating income exceeding our operating expenses, and have been 100% supported by fees from our member organizations ever since. Our membership is broadly diversified both across sectors and geographically; we count funders, policy makers, publishers and vendors among our membership, however the broadest slice of membership, both in numeric and financial terms, comes from universities and other research institutions around the world, making up 70% of our membership base. Over 75% of our member organizations are based in jurisdictions outside of the US.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Since 2019, ORCID has been 100% supported by fees from our member organizations, and over 75% of our member organizations are based in jurisdictions outside of the US.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Our status as a US-based non-profit has not changed, and as we are subject to laws of the US Internal Revenue Service, we still cannot be sold. Should ORCID ever cease to exist, our assets have to continue to be used exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we finalized all obligations from our original startup loans. Fifty-five percent of them were graciously forgiven by the original lenders, and were used to establish our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-announces-launch-of-new-global-participation-program-and-1m-global-participation-fundorcid-announces-launch-of-new-global-participation-program/" data-wpel-link="internal">Global Participation Fund</a>, which provides grants aimed at decreasing barriers to ORCID participation in regions defined as having lower- or lower-middle income economies. The remainder of our startup loans have been repaid in full with interest and we are now debt-free. It is worth noting here that with the exception of a small COVID-era loan which was available to all US-based employers, we have never relied on grant funding from the US government to cover ORCID’s operational expenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our membership renewal rate remains strong at around 97%, even as we have instituted an annual fee increase to keep up with the global inflation rate which affects our cost base as much as it does any other organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">In 2024 ORCID established a formal long-term capital reserve fund to ensure the sustainability of the organization into the future, which can only be used with the explicit authority of our Board.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to the support of our members, we have consistently generated a modest operating surplus in each year since 2019, which enabled us in 2024 to establish a formal long-term capital reserve fund. Intended to help ensure the sustainability of the organization into the future, the long-term reserve can only be used with the explicit authority of our Board, and only for the following purposes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>To fund periodic one-off investments necessary to deliver ORCID’s mission and strategic objectives</li>



<li>To underwrite unforeseeable short-term operating cash shortfalls in order to maintain operational stability and continuity in fulfilling ORCID’s mission, in accordance with the measures and goals of the Board approved annual budget</li>



<li>To facilitate the orderly wind-down of the organization should ORCID’s mission become fulfilled</li>



<li>To fulfill the transition of the mission to a successor organization should ORCID no longer be viable in its current form.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-our-governance">Our Governance</h2>

<p><em>To ensure we abide by these principles, we are <a href="https://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid/governance" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">governed</a> by a volunteer Board.

<p><em>The <a href="https://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid/principles" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID Principle</a> that researchers are able to create an ORCID iD and edit and maintain an ORCID record free of charge is enshrined in our bylaws, and any proposed change to that provision needs to be approved not only by the Board of Directors, but also by our members. Any changes to our bylaws would need to be voted on by ORCID’s membership. At the time of writing, more than 70% of ORCID members are research-performing organizations or funders, placing the future of ORCID squarely under their control.</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-2">2025 Update: still true</h3>


<p>ORCID continues to hold Board elections every year utilizing a nominations process that gives ORCID members a direct voice in ORCID’s direction and priorities. All ORCID member organizations are eligible to nominate a representative to stand for election to serve as a Member-Director on the Board. In addition, we now reserve two seats on the Board for Researcher-Directors who are practicing scholars and do not need to be affiliated with an ORCID member organization.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dispute-management">Dispute Management</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-4">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>ORCID offers tools for storing and managing data in the ORCID Registry. ORCID does not edit or curate data; that is the responsibility of the individual in concert with members to whom they grant access permissions. While ORCID does not control the data in the ORCID Registry or individual records, we are committed to supporting a transparent and accurate data environment. We have a set of procedures for receiving questions about the Registry, APIs, and our policies. Most queries are managed by our fabulous help desk. For those queries where data accuracy is questioned, we have a specific <a href="https://orcid.org/orcid-dispute-procedures" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">dispute procedure</a> for receiving and managing the query. <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Let us know</a> if something doesn’t look right!</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-3">2025 Update: still true</h3>


<p>We continue to stay true to our policy that ORCID does not edit or curate data. We enable anyone who might benefit from using the ORCID Registry to be able to obtain and use an ORCID iD. Any rigid definition of who would “qualify” for an iD would likely unintentionally exclude people for whom an ORCID iD would be useful due to the wide diversity of circumstances researchers find themselves in around the world. It is specifically by not setting any such criteria on who can register for an ORCID record that we ensure inclusivity and encourage the persistence of ORCID iDs. We want to encourage budding researchers to establish their ORCID iDs as early in their careers as possible, as undergrads — even if they have not yet created any formally recognized research outputs. Similarly, we don’t wish to exclude independent researchers such as citizen scientists or those currently unaffiliated with a formal academic institution due to career breaks or retirement.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">While ORCID has always carefully maintained metadata about the provenance of each item added to an ORCID record, in 2024 we made it easier for users of ORCID data to visualize this information with the introduction of &#8220;Trust Markers.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While ORCID has always carefully maintained metadata about the provenance of each item added to an ORCID record, we have made it easier for users to visualize this information with the introduction of &#8220;Trust Markers.&#8221; Each item on an ORCID record is now accompanied by a Trust Marker that makes it easier to understand which data has been contributed by the record holder themselves, or by one of our member organizations via their authenticated integration with the ORCID registry. We’ve also added Record Summaries, which make it easier to understand the provenance of an entire record at a glance, which are available both at the top of each ORCID record and in machine readable form via our APIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flip side to that openness and inclusivity is the inevitable inclusion of individuals who may not be considered by the broader scholarly community to be legitimate researchers and that some of the data that they choose to share on their records may not be considered by others to be objectively true. Our dispute procedure, in place since 2012, has withstood the test of time, with our helpdesk having successfully handled over 400 disputes, the majority of which are found to be due to genuine errors and are resolved amicably. When a dispute is raised and the data in the disputed record cannot be substantiated by the record holder, we “lock” it, removing it from use and visibility. We have also introduced&nbsp; automated spam detection processes, so problematic records, usually created to try to commercially gain from ORCID’s strong position in search engines and other indexes, can be identified and locked quickly. We are currently able to identify and lock over 2,200 spam records per week with 99% accuracy. All the same, if something doesn’t look right, we still invite you to <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">let us know</a>!</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-involving-the-community">Involving the Community</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-5">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>In my first post-launch blog back in 2012, I wrote about how <a href="https://orcid.org/content/o-orcid" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">the O in ORCID stands for open</a>. ORCID is strongly committed to openness. Of our 10 principles, seven deal directly with openness in at least one of its meanings. In addition to providing free access, no barriers to access for individuals, democratic and transparent governance, and open source software, we also are open … when it comes to working with the community. We know that, for any standard to be implemented, it must work for any individual regardless of discipline or location, and for any organization regardless of whether it is non-profit, governmental, commercial, etc. We live and breathe collaboration; it is our lifeblood.</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-4">2025 Update: still true</h3>


<p>Nine years later, we look for every possible opportunity to collaborate with members of ORCID’s broad community on as many of our initiatives and projects as we can. Standing interest and working groups such as the ORAC, our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/consortia-interest-group/" data-wpel-link="internal">Consortia Interest Group</a>, and <a href="https://info.orcid.org/funders-interest-group/" data-wpel-link="internal">Funder Interest Group</a> meet regularly to discuss and give feedback on in-progress projects, or initiatives under discovery. For example, our recent release of expanded Work Type vocabulary (that includes outputs common for Arts and Humanities scholars) and our implementation of Record Summaries, discussed above, were reviewed by ORAC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used insights gleaned from an open community review process to refine the workflow-based criteria we use in our Certified Service Provider program. We host numerous Webinar series that showcase the diverse sectors and ORCID use cases from around the community and give our members a platform to share their knowledge with others, and members of our Engagement Team regularly present at webinars and in-person events around the world.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reliability">Reliability</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-6">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>ORCID iDs need to be embedded in the systems and services that research depends on: from publisher submission systems to funder databases to electronic lab notebooks to university personnel systems. The ORCID registry is itself a piece of research infrastructure, and ORCID iDs are components in other infrastructures. This interdependency is a strength and a challenge. We need to effectively communicate our plans and problems. We cannot hide. We’ve had an open development board since our launch. We have an international team managing API support, a community suggestions board, and a 24/7 user help desk. When we make a mistake we admit it — quickly. And we fix it — quickly. We rely on the community to do the same.</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p> Nearly 6,000 systems that we know of are integrated with our API; yet more that we don’t know about are using our anonymous API. Together, these systems access data from our APIs between 150M and 200M times each month, with over 99.99% uptime.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-but-it-s-about-more-than-just-reliability">2025 Update: still true, but it’s about more than just reliability</h3>


<p>The ORCID registry is now firmly established as an indispensable piece of research infrastructure, with ORCID iDs embedded into numerous workflows to facilitate efficient and accurate identification and exchange of research metadata. Nearly 6,000 systems that we know of are integrated with our API; yet more that we don’t know about are using our anonymous API. Together, these systems access data from our APIs between 150M and 200M times each month. And all of this is achieved with over 99.99% uptime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Connecting ORCID with external systems and services used for research does more than evidence the reliability of ORCID: it eases administrative burden for researchers, as their data can be machine-read and reused by those systems, reducing or eliminating the need for them to rekey their data into multiple platforms or applications. It also strengthens the integrity of the scholarly record itself as data added by our member organizations’ validated external systems such as universities, publishers, or funders, is accompanied by a Trust Marker that can be embedded into research integrity workflows to get a comprehensive picture of a researcher&#8217;s outputs and affiliations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cybersecurity and technology risks comprise the largest fraction of ORCID’s total identified risk profile, and threats are ever growing. The actual impact on the community of any single cybersecurity breach against ORCID is likely to be limited&nbsp;— we do not hold any sensitive information, and the majority of the information we hold is publicly available in any case. However, given ORCID’s central position as a key component of the scholarly infrastructure, and the global trust that we’ve worked hard to build to gain that position, the impact to ORCID’s reputation of a significant incident could be devastating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we have been fortunate not to have been the target of a significant cyber-attack to date, with cyber threats growing in complexity and frequency, in 2024 we formally launched a new multi-year cybersecurity program, commencing with the selection of an external fractional CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) to help us prioritize mitigation of the most significant of risks, as well as identify as-yet unknown risks and address any&nbsp; gaps in our cybersecurity defence strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is one area that has evolved quite a bit since 2016, it’s that we have a much clearer understanding about the important role that ORCID — and the member organizations that support our work — have to play in helping to maintain trust in the global research ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insurance">Insurance</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-we-said-7">In 2016, we said</h3>


<p><em>We recognize that trust is the key to adoption and sustainability. If you decide you don’t like what we are doing, you effectively have an insurance policy. Our openness means that, if circumstances require, the community could recreate ORCID by collecting and re-assembling our parts. You can use our CC0 public data, our open software source code, our open documentation together with the community we are helping to build, to create a new community-led alternative and ensure the continuation of the ORCID vision.</em></p>



<p><em>ORCID is open. We are built by you and for you. Together we can achieve our vision for the benefit of the global research community.</em></p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-update-still-true-orcid-is-open-access-open-source">2025 Update: still true – ORCID is open access, open source</h3>


<p>ORCID has always taken steps to ensure that our work can persist if, for whatever reason, ORCID in its current form ceases to be viable. Measures include:</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-our-annual-public-data-file-available-openly-via-an-independent-data-repository">Making our annual public data file available openly via an independent data repository.</h4>


<p>ORCID’s Public Data File has been published annually since 2012, presenting a snapshot of the publicly available data found in the ORCID registry at the time of publication. Hosted by Figshare, an independent third party, on servers that reside in Ireland and Germany, it has been downloaded more than 190,000 times, serving as a data source for a diverse range of projects such as the analysis of relationships and individual trajectories within the research community, scientific migrations, collaboration networks, and the adoption of ORCID across disciplines and locations. It is published under a CC0 public domain dedication, subject to our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/public-data-file-use-policy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Public Data File Use Policy</a>. We are currently working with the non-profit&nbsp; <a href="https://clockss.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">CLOCKSS</a> archive to establish long-term digital preservation of our public data in their twelve archive nodes located at leading research libraries around the world.</p>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-open-sourcing-our-software-and-making-our-code-freely-downloadable">Open-sourcing our software and making our code freely downloadable</h4>


<p>The software developed by ORCID is <a href="https://info.orcid.org/open-source-project-license/#:~:text=The%20software%20developed%20by%20ORCID,Open%20Source%20project%20Github%20pages." data-wpel-link="internal">open source</a> and published in a set of open repositories, again hosted by an independent third party, in this case Github. We welcome contributions to our code base. Pull requests can be submitted via <a href="https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Open Source project Github pages.</a> The ORCID Registry source code is collected and archived by the non-profit <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Software Heritage Foundation</a>, and we are currently working to improve the consistency and completeness of those archives across all of our code repositories.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/2024-privacy-policy-update/" data-wpel-link="internal">privacy policy</a> confirms our position that, to the extent possible, we will extend the data subject rights found in the GDPR to everyone whose data we process, regardless of where they are located.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ensuring-full-compliance-with-gdpr-and-other-international-privacy-regulations">Ensuring full compliance with GDPR and other international privacy regulations</h4>


<p>Although privacy regulation is rapidly evolving around the world, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) remains the “gold standard” against which most other regulations are compared. Our recent <a href="https://info.orcid.org/2024-privacy-policy-update/" data-wpel-link="internal">privacy policy</a> update confirms our position that, to the extent possible, we will extend the data subject rights found in the GDPR to everyone whose data we process, regardless of where they are located.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We remain committed to the policy that ORCID will provide only the minimum non-public data to regulators, enforcement agents, courts and/or other government entities as we deem necessary to comply with the law, and to the extent allowed, we will promptly provide information about any government data requests received to the relevant record holders.</p>



<p>By taking this approach, we aim to meet the highest level of privacy rights for all record holders and other stakeholders around the world.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-is-built-to-be-persistent-and-independent-now-and-into-the-future">ORCID is built to be persistent and independent — now and into the future</h2>


<p>ORCID strongly believes that the best way to persist in a world that is rapidly changing is by staying true to the values and principles that earned us the trust of our community in the first place.&nbsp;As stated in our 2016 blog post, <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-we-wont-be-sold/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID: We won’t be sold</a>, trust starts with transparency and consistency. Over the nine years since, ORCID has remained true to our mission and values. We will continue to hold ourselves accountable to those who use and support our activities around the world through our principles, business model, governance, and operational processes, fiercely defending our independence and holding ourselves transparently accountable to our community in every way we can.</p>

Their generous contributions increase the available funding for ORCID’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-program/#gpf" data-wpel-link="internal">Global Participation Fund</a></span>&nbsp;(GPF), which provides grants to build ORCID Communities of Practice in currently under-represented regions and for improving ORCID integrations in open-source scholarly platforms. Along with the support of the original launch partners of our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-program/" data-wpel-link="internal">Global Participation Program</a></span>&nbsp;(GPP), the total funding raised for the GPF now stands at just short of US$1.5M.</p>



<p>“We are grateful for the kind support of IEEE, OUP, RSC, and Sage in helping us address current imbalances in ORCID adoption around the world,” said ORCID’s Executive Director, Chris Shillum. “In the two years since <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-announces-launch-of-new-global-participation-program-and-1m-global-participation-fundorcid-announces-launch-of-new-global-participation-program/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID launched the GPF</a></span>, we have awarded over $350K in funding to 20 organizations across the Global South, and to teams that build open-source platforms that are heavily used in those regions. We are thrilled to be able to increase the funding available to continue these grant programs, furthering &nbsp;our ability to bridge the ORCID participation gap and improve equity of access to interconnected research infrastructure in currently under-represented regions.”</p>



<p>With these additional contributions, we are also &nbsp;happy to share that ORCID’s obligations for repayment of our original startup loans are now complete, enhancing our financial stability and increasing confidence in our long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>Andy Heard, IEEE&#8217;s Sr. Director of Publishing Technology said ORCID is an essential part of IEEE’s reputation as an ethical publisher. IEEE is the largest technical professional organization in the world that is dedicated to advancing technology for human benefit. It publishes highly cited journals, hosts conferences, issues technology standards, and fosters professional and educational development.</p>



<p>“Having confidence that a person is who they say they are is essential to ensuring integrity within the publishing ecosystem,” said Heard. “As an ethical publisher, IEEE relies on tools such as ORCID to establish trust in researcher identity.”</p>



<p>Another ORCID supporter is, Oxford University Press (OUP), the publishing house of the University of Oxford, boasts being the largest university press in the world as well as the second-oldest. James Phillpotts, Director of OUPs’ Content Transformation &amp; Standards, notes that OUP believes in publishing with a purpose to ensure availability of the highest quality academic and educational resources and services across the world.</p>



<p>“There is a clear synergy with the goal of ORCID’s Global Participation Program, to improve equity of access to interconnected research infrastructure, enabling transparent and trustworthy connections between researchers, their contributions, and their affiliations,” he said. “In supporting this Program, the Press hopes to help address the priorities of research communities in lower/middle-income countries and to improve equity and visibility for the high quality academic contributions of their researchers.”</p>



<p>Sage Publishing, an American independent academic publishing company, founded in 1965 publishes more than a thousand journals per year. “Investing in ORCID and its Global Participation Program is investing in both the publishing infrastructure and the global publishing community—especially in researchers who are underrepresented in that community,” said Andrew Smeall, Vice President of Product Innovation at Sage. “ORCID adoption reduces the administrative burden for authors and helps them gain recognition for their work— all while easing research integrity practices for publishers and editors. As a publisher that cares deeply about global representation, participation, and trust in science, Sage is very happy to further support this program.” </p>

<p><em>Openness</em> is one of ORCID’s foundational values, and sharing our annual ORCID Public Data File is one example of our commitment to openness.

<p>Since the launch of the ORCID registry in October 2012, we have published the Public Data File annually, accessible freely and openly by all, as a means to ensure that any interested stakeholder has broad access to a dataset that has become a vital part of the scholarly communication infrastructure. We’re pleased to announce that we have now taken it a step further — to make the Public Data File more <em>accessible</em> — by partnering with Digital Science to provide a means of accessing the file in a way that, for the first time, facilitates exploratory data analysis.</p>

<p>In the 12 years that ORCID has been sharing the Public Data File, it has been downloaded more than 190,000 times, serving as a data source for a diverse range of projects such as the analysis of relationships and individual trajectories within the research community, scientific migrations, collaboration networks, and the adoption of ORCID across disciplines and locations. However, we understand that using the Public Data File in its current form requires a large amount of effort. Would-be users must possess an understanding of and skill with working with such a substantial dataset: how to download, parse, extract, and upload the data into a local environment—before analysis can even begin.</p>

<p>Building on our current relationship with Figshare which serves as the repository for the Public Data File, ORCID member Digital Science has now generously offered to host the 2024 Public Data File into Dimension’s Google Big Query (GBQ), meaning that the data is directly available for exploration and analysis without the need to first create a local copy. </p>

<p>Google Big Query is a cloud-based, fully-managed data analytics platform, optimized for handling large datasets efficiently. This makes it an ideal platform for exploring and analyzing the ORCID Public Data File, which contains millions of records. The ORCID Public Data File has been used for projects such as metadata enrichment, <a href="https://info.orcid.org/celebrating-open-access-week-institutional-uses-of-the-orcid-public-data-file/" data-wpel-link="internal">visualizing connections between authors</a>, <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-celebrates-open-access-week-with-release-of-public-data-file/" data-wpel-link="internal">data sharing practices in a particular region</a>, <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-celebrates-open-access-week-with-release-of-public-data-file/" data-wpel-link="internal">and analysis of scientist migration patterns</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/open-datasets.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The beta version of this service is now available</a>, and we hope that the lower effort required to use it will enable our community to explore and develop new innovative use cases for the ORCID data, such as reporting on peer review practices, or analysis that involves linking ORCID data with data from the World Bank. While the dataset itself is and will remain freely available, those wishing to use it will need to establish their own GBQ account; Google offers a free tier of usage up to a certain level, but levies fees for usage beyond that. Within the free tier, it is possible to run many queries before running out of quota. Digital Science has also provided <a href="https://bigquery-lab.dimensions.ai/tutorials/09-orcid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">example sample queries</a> that allow you to efficiently query different parts of the ORCID dataset.</p>



<p>To be clear, this service is offered in addition to, and does not replace, the archival copies of our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/documentation/integration-guide/working-with-bulk-data/" data-wpel-link="internal">Public Data File</a>, which continue to be available for download from our Figshare repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/services/annual-data-files/" data-wpel-link="internal">on our website</a>, The ORCID Public Data File contains all publicly available information for all ORCID iDs within the registry at the time of creation.

<p>In this version of the service, the ORCID Public Data File on Google Big Query reflects the data that is contained in the ORCID summaries files, meaning that extended details of work level (e.g. article) metadata is still only available in the downloadable versions of the ORCID Public Data File available on Figshare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this month, our ORCID consortia community came together from 15 different countries for an engaging and productive one-and-a-half-day meeting in Munich, hosted by the Ludwig Maximillian Universität. The sessions provided valuable insights into the achievements and challenges of consortia leads while reinforcing a shared sense of purpose in advancing open infrastructure.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learning-problem-solving-and-strategy"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning, problem-solving, and strategy</span></h2>


<p>The event was a great opportunity for the 16 participating consortia to share their achievements and lessons learned, providing a rich exchange of experiences. Through shared challenges and successes emerged a strong sense of belonging.</p>



<p>A key focus on the first day was community engagement and how to grow consortia. Together with board member Clare Appavoo (CRKN), we led a discussion on attracting new members and increasing uptake. The day continued with a collaborative problem-solving activity that allowed participants to explore ways to support members more effectively, tackling common challenges together.</p>



<p>Consortia also had the possibility of contributing to ORCID’s strategic development for the plan next cycle (2026–2029), through a dynamic session that encouraged reflection and debate. The second day featured a dedicated session where two board members, Heath Marks (AAF) and César Rendón (Consortia), shared their experiences as board members and the initial motivation they had to apply for the board. This provided participants with a better understanding of ORCID’s broader activities and governance.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-highlighting-the-value-of-in-person-meetings"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Highlighting the value of in-person meetings</span></h2>


<p>One of the intentions of these in-person consortia workshops is to help strengthen connections and build a sense of community and camaraderie. Being able to share challenges and successes makes the discussions deeper and more meaningful. Problem-solving activities helped group engagement, while strategy talks provided consortia leads with an overview of the ORCID strategy development cycle, giving them the option to contribute their opinions about ORCID’s development path and position in crucial aspects of the scholarly communication ecosystem, such as the influence of AI technologies. Participants also exchanged useful ideas, like improving newsletters, member onboarding, and integration support, leading to clear next steps for action.</p>



<p>We look forward to meeting in person again in September 2025, with appreciation to the Tertiary Education and Research Network of South Africa (TENET) for hosting!</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-continuing-discussions-virtually"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuing discussions virtually</span></h2>


<p>Apart from the in-person meetings, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/consortia-interest-group/" data-wpel-link="internal">Consortia Interest Group</a></span>&nbsp;(CIG) meets quarterly in two different sessions to accommodate participants’ different time zones. The CIG consists of up to two representatives from each consortia lead organization to share successes, lessons learned, and how they’ve overcome challenges. Co-chairs from our CIG community help facilitate meaningful conversations. Our next virtual meetings will take place in April and June. </p>



<p>If your organization is thinking about becoming a consortia lead, we encourage you to start with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-for-consortia-roles-responsibilities-print-version/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID for Consortia: Roles &amp; Responsibilities</a></span>&nbsp;and <a href="http://support.orcid.org" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reach out to us</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After thorough review and discussion with the ORCID Board late last year, ORCID is happy to announce our endorsement of the Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information as an institutional supporter. We are pleased to see how the declaration, a community-driven initiative with over 100 signatories and 40 supporters, highlights growing support for sustainable infrastructure for research information. As a community-governed non-profit research infrastructure provider, ORCID considers all opportunities for community commitments, including endorsements, through a framework established by our Board of Directors, by which we assess the call for commitment against several criteria, including whether or not the commitment conflicts with our founding principles, our values, or would jeopardize our non-profit status. </p>



<p>A fundamental goal of ORCID is to connect researchers with their research in an open, equitable way that enables transparent generation of insights about not only researchers, but their institutions.</p>



<p>From a researcher’s perspective, ORCID allows them to claim credit for their work and contributions, no matter where they are or what their discipline. It also reduces the burden required to manage their careers as they reuse their profile data in a variety of scholarly workflows.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdcIpNvYTp1Ya1RllLSQd6_VaW2VXAhv6YkW_gQKgtzyqo0WeNGQ0DQ-yLXWvwkqnl8-9oA6R2gZmBm339PysohsRCAShGGMbkzdvc30zHV_hrrBTDGr1oT4_MvVhmTf5S3zqWThg?key=iXsgsCaEeSUJMF9y_VeMPWhD" alt="purple graphic with the text: Barcelona Declaration on Open research information. Because fair assessment of researchers and institutions requires full transparency." style="width:321px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>As an open infrastructure organization, ORCID enables the sharing of researcher and research-related metadata within any FAIR-enabled infrastructure. This allows researcher and institutional evaluations to be based on open, transparent data engendering trust, strengthening the scholarly record, and ultimately helping to uphold research integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORCID recognizes the Barcelona Declaration as an important framework by which scholarly systems can be integrated in a transparent way, while supporting all varieties of our members’ business models. We applaud the signatory organizations in their commitment to support the sustainability of infrastructures for open research information, and their endeavors toward increasing the openness and transparency of research assessment. In doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to our own vision and mission, and to the principles by which we were founded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are pleased to share exciting news for the Nigerian research and academic community: the first ORCID consortium in Nigeria, led by Eko-Konnect, has officially launched with three member institutions. This marks a significant step forward for scholarly collaboration and visibility, as well as a testament to the power of ORCID’s Global Participation Fund (GPF) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-program/#mep" data-wpel-link="internal">Membership Equity Program</a></span>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Nigerian ORCID consortium exemplifies the transformative impact of the GPF, a program designed to provide financial and strategic support for organizations in underrepresented regions to establish ORCID consortia.</p><cite>Lombe Tembo</cite></blockquote></figure>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eko-konnect-pioneering-research-collaboration"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eko-Konnect: Pioneering research collaboration</span></h2>


<p>Eko-Konnect, a trailblazing organization in advancing digital research infrastructure in Nigeria, is leading this consortium. With support from ORCID’s GPF, this initiative brings together academic and research institutions across Nigeria to streamline scholarly communication, foster collaboration, and enhance global research visibility.</p>



<p>The Nigerian ORCID consortium exemplifies the transformative impact of the GPF, a program designed to provide financial and strategic support for organizations in underrepresented regions to establish ORCID consortia. By leveraging the Membership Equity Program, Eko-Konnect and the other member institutions in the consortium—Covenant University and Landmark University—benefit from a more accessible path to ORCID membership, ensuring that resources are allocated where they’re needed most.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters-for-nigerian-researchers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why this matters for Nigerian researchers</span></h2>


<p>The establishment of the Nigerian ORCID consortium creates opportunities for researchers and institutions to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improve research discoverability:</span>&nbsp;ORCID’s unique identifiers ensure that researchers’ contributions are accurately attributed, no matter where they’re published.</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Streamline research workflows:</span>&nbsp;Members gain access to integrations that reduce administrative burdens and improve efficiency.</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Foster collaboration:</span>&nbsp;A unified consortium provides a platform for Nigerian institutions to collaborate on shared goals and challenges in research management.</li>
</ul>



<p>This consortium isn’t just a win for Nigeria, it’s a model for other countries seeking to enhance their academic infrastructure through collective action and global support.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opportunities-for-interested-organizations"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opportunities for interested organizations</span></h2>


<p>As the Nigerian consortium demonstrates, it is possible to establish a new consortium with a small number of institutions. For Nigerian organizations, Eko-Konnect is actively welcoming new members to expand the reach and impact of this initiative. Joining the consortium offers a chance to be part of a growing network that’s shaping the future of Nigerian research. Nigerian organizations will have the opportunity to learn more about joining the consortium at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://2025.eko-konnect.org.ng/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Eko Konnect Users Conference</a></span>&nbsp;in Lagos, Nigeria, from 29–30 January, 2025.</p>



<p>Additionally, organizations worldwide that are inspired by this success story are encouraged to consider applying for the next cycle of the GPF. Applications will open in May 2025, offering a chance to access funding and support for establishing ORCID consortia in your region.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-join-the-movement-be-part-of-the-change"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Join the movement—Be part of the change</span></h2>


<p>The Nigerian ORCID consortium is a groundbreaking achievement, showcasing what’s possible when global resources meet local expertise and determination. Whether you’re a Nigerian institution looking to join the consortium or an organization elsewhere seeking support through the GPF, now is the time to take action.</p>



<p>Nigerian organizations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:grants@orcid.org">please get in touch</a></span>&nbsp;to explore membership opportunities in the ORCID consortium. For others, mark your calendars for May 2025 to apply for the next GPF cycle and visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-program/#gpf" data-wpel-link="internal">Global Participation Fund</a></span>&nbsp;page for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-program/global-participation-fund-faqs/" data-wpel-link="internal">FAQs</a></span>&nbsp;and more information about the application process.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce we just released a new set of work types that promise to make ORCID records more usable for arts and humanities scholars! Our goal in introducing these was to both expand the types of research outputs that can be represented in ORCID records, while providing a better user experience (with better guidance!) for manual entry. We want researchers to be able to easily find and choose the category that best suits their needs, without being overwhelmed by a long list of ambiguous choices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-also-improved-the-overall-experience-of-selecting-work-types">We also improved the overall experience of selecting work types</h2>


<p>In addition to adding new work types, we have refined some of the existing types to decrease confusion where they seemed redundant or unclear to users, mapping them to the COAR vocabulary wherever possible. The types that have been merged or refined to map to COAR are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conference abstract:</span>&nbsp;Replaced with the more general ‘conference output’ (from COAR);</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edited book:</span>&nbsp;Replaced with ‘book’ (closest equivalent from COAR). This type was confusing because “edited book” is a role or an action; “book” is a resource.</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture/speech:</span>&nbsp; Replaced with ‘lecture’ for academic talks (from COAR) and &nbsp;‘public speech’ for dissemination activities (new work type);</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manual and Test:</span>&nbsp; Replaced with ‘learning object’ (from COAR, and which is labeled ‘teaching materials’ in English);</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technical standards:</span>&nbsp; Replaced by ‘report’ (from COAR).</li>
</ul>



<p>We have also deprecated a few types that have proved to have low usage from our community, which means they are no longer available to select in the My ORCID page. However, due to compatibility considerations, they are still supported by our APIs. We have deprecated the following work types:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Newsletter article:</span>&nbsp;Deprecated due to low usage and no equivalent COAR type. Instead, we recommend using ‘magazine’ or ‘newspaper article’ types;</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclosure:</span>&nbsp;Deprecated due to low usage and generally incorrect usage;</li>



<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spin off company: </span>Deprecated due to low usage and no equivalent COAR type.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-members-can-add-new-types-of-data-via-the-member-api"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ORCID members can add new types of data via the Member API</span></h2>


<p>Like most data found in an ORCID record, works data is added in two distinct ways:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Automatically, by an ORCID member using the ORCID API, or</li>



<li>Manually, by the researcher directly via their My ORCID page.</li>

<p>The ability to add data to ORCID records via the ORCID API is an exclusive member benefit, and we encourage our member organizations to add authoritative data that they hold about researchers on their behalf. Not only does this reduce researchers’ administrative burden, but it adds a trust marker to the data that can be used in integrity checks in workflows such as the submission of grant applications.</p>



<p>An ORCID member organization wishing to make use of the new work types must be using Member API 3.0 or higher, and will need to update their integration to re-map their internal classifications to the new ORCID work types. This will allow them to not only add these new types of Works data to researchers’ records, but they will also be able to update Works they may have previously categorized as “Other.”</p>



<p>Of course, if you are a researcher, we welcome you to log into your record and see for yourself what new kinds of Works data you — or your organization — can now add to your record!</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-arts-and-humanities-works-have-been-historically-underrepresented-in-orcid-records"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arts and humanities Works have been historically underrepresented in ORCID records</span></h2>


<p>Over the years, scholarly communities focused on the arts and humanities have provided us with the feedback that, while they appreciate the concept of ORCID and understand the promise of ORCID records, in practice they found them to be of limited use. Though we have 151 million works in the ORCID registry, associated with 6.7 million researchers, non-STEM outputs have historically been underrepresented at least in part due to the lack of appropriate work types by which to classify them.</p>



<p>Humanities-focused researchers who wished to add previously unsupported types of works to their records were limited to selecting the “Other” category, which had the unfortunate side effect of “othering” their work, or making it seem as if their research outputs were not as valued as other STEM-centric outputs, such as journal articles. ORCID certainly doesn’t see it this way, though we sympathize with the perspective of frustrated humanities scholars. The work required to rectify this properly involved careful planning and, of course, the involvement of our community, which is why we invited your input in this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-expanding-work-type-vocabulary/" data-wpel-link="internal">blog post</a></span>&nbsp;from last July that outlined a proposal for the new work type scheme.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mapping-to-a-community-maintained-vocabulary"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mapping to a community-maintained vocabulary</span></h2>


<p>In creating a new set of work types that are as useful as possible to the widest range of users, ORCID didn’t want to reinvent the wheel; we prefer to re-use existing community taxonomies wherever possible. So we sought out the best available taxonomy to ensure the new categories we offered would be as interoperable as possible, over time, across a broad spectrum of systems in the research community.</p>



<p>After reviewing several candidates, we have aligned our new work types to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/resource_types/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Controlled Vocabularies for Repositories</a></span>&nbsp;— a living standard rigorously maintained by experts with a commitment to sustainability through the Confederation of Open Access Repositories <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/resource_types/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">(COAR)</a></span>. We chose the COAR vocabulary based on a multitude of criteria: mappability, coverage, suitability for our use case, status of and commitment to maintenance, as well as interoperability.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-work-types-mean-new-possibilities-for-orcid-and-for-our-community"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New work types mean new possibilities for ORCID, and for our community</span></h2>


<p>The addition of these new humanities-based work types is a long-awaited development both for ORCID and for our community, and we are excited to discover the use cases that our expanded support will catalyze. We invite you to explore the new types of works available in ORCID records:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The American Chemical Society (ACS) was an early member of ORCID and now has five integrations—four custom and one built on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/publisher-solutions/scholarone/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ScholarOne</a></span>&nbsp;Manuscript Submission System. To-date, the integration with ScholarOne has helped ACS contribute more than 1.5 million items of data to the ORCID Registry, making it one of the top contributors of trusted data to ORCID records. ScholarOne allows ACS to collect authenticated ORCID IDs of its authors and reviewers and adds peer-review items to the reviewers&#8217; records.</p>



<p>The following interview is with Sarah Tegen, PhD, Senior Vice President and Chief Publishing Officer, ACS Publications at the American Chemical Society.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-main-reasons-for-your-organization-adopting-orcid"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the main reasons for your organization adopting ORCID?</span></h3>


<p>ACS has supported ORCID since the beginning. Having unique identifiers for researchers and scholars, so that they will be consistently linked to all of their research activities and institutional affiliations, builds a foundation for trust across the scientific community. For authors, it enables more efficient workflows and resolves ambiguity in the way they are identified, which helps them create an authenticated record of their scholarly publishing. The identifier also helps to simplify and speed up grant applications—something we know is important to researchers. For end users, having unique identifiers improves search accuracy and discoverability.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-integration-with-orcid-was-implemented-in-2015-has-anything-changed-over-time"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This integration with ORCID was implemented in 2015. Has anything changed over time? </span></h3>


<p>Over time we’ve seen why it becomes even more important to be able to uniquely identify researchers across platforms, publishers, institutional affiliations, and scientific disciplines. In early 2020, ACS Publications announced that reviewers of ACS journal articles could create an authenticated record of their efforts through ORCID. ACS also publishes more journals and more articles now than it did in 2015, and we continue to see tremendous growth in global submissions of papers.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-technical-or-communications-challenges-did-you-face-along-the-way-how-did-you-overcome-them"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What technical or communications challenges did you face along the way? How did you overcome them?</span></h3>


<p>The process requires validation and passing information to a number of platforms. We had to update our content schema, content processes, and article rendering to support and display ORCID identifiers. To get into the details a bit, it works like this: The corresponding authors supply their ORCIDs during the manuscript submission process. To validate that the ORCID belongs to the author, they are required to authenticate by logging into their record. These ORCID values, along with a “validated” flag, are passed along to article production upon acceptance. These ORCIDs, along with other author information, are used to create author identity tags within our content XML, and those tags are included in the PDF and HTML versions of the articles. The ORCIDs also are included in the metadata feeds sent to Crossref and other third parties. CHORUS and other metadata consumers make use of the ORCIDs from there.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-have-you-seen-researchers-benefiting-by-contributing-data-about-their-peer-review-activities-to-their-records"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How have you seen researchers benefiting by contributing data about their peer review activities to their records?</span></h3>


<p>We’ve already talked about the importance of researchers being able to create a record of their work. Another way that researchers and their institutions can benefit is through improved compliance with reporting requirements from funding agencies. For example, the National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM-33), issued in 2021 by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, specified requirements to strengthen and standardize disclosure requirements for federally funded awards. Those requirements included digital persistent identifiers.</p>



<p>And of course, any tools that can help address the problem of fraudulent research papers are important for the entire scientific community.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-other-ways-has-orcid-helped-you-in-your-processes"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What other ways has ORCID helped you in your processes?</span></h3>


<p>We use ORCIDs within our author name change process as a method of authenticating the request. Additionally, the cross-publisher initiative CHORUS, which operates in cooperation with a number of U.S. federal funding agencies, leverages ORCIDs in its dashboards to promote traceability in open science. Lastly, our internal data analytic processes use ORCID to disambiguate and deduplicate author names during data collection.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-you-have-any-recommendations-you-would-like-to-share-with-other-organizations-that-are-planning-to-adopt-orcid"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have any recommendations you would like to share with other organizations that are planning to adopt ORCID?</span></h3>


<p>Collect authenticated iDs! In other words, require authentication to ORCID.org when accepting ORCID values; do not just supply an ORCID “text box” to fill in. Authentication reduces the likelihood of making errors and makes it harder to misuse the system. It also leverages the power of data interoperability made possible by the integration in the first place, reducing burden on the part of researchers and ensuring the sharing of high quality data.</p>

<p>PTCRIS—Portugal’s national research information system—has championed the principle, “Register once, reuse always,” streamlining research management for Portuguese researchers. While ORCID adoption isn’t mandatory, it has become highly encouraged due to its numerous benefits for researchers. By integrating ORCID with national systems like CIÊNCIAVITAE, PTCRIS has significantly reduced the administrative burden on researchers, saving them valuable time and effort.</p>



<p>Through PTCRISync, researchers no longer need to manually update their profiles across various platforms. New projects or publications added to ORCID are automatically synced with CIÊNCIAVITAE, ensuring data accuracy without redundant effort. This integration has saved over 154 hours of administrative work, allowing researchers to dedicate more time to their research.</p>



<p>This session explored how this seamless integration is reshaping the research landscape and how ORCID is becoming an indispensable tool in simplifying academic workflows.</p>

<p>We are pleased to share that <a href="https://localcontexts.org" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Local Contexts</a> and ORCID have embarked on a cooperation agreement to foster the adoption of the <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">CARE Principles</a> for Indigenous Data Governance, Local Contexts Labels and Notices and ORCID identifiers throughout the research data lifecycle.</p>



<p>The agreement, in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), formalizes the mutual interaction and strengthens the existing relationship between the Local Contexts and ORCID at an operational level, focusing on building awareness of and encouraging researchers to register for and use their ORCID iD throughout the research data lifecycle, as well as to adopt the CARE principles and appropriate use of Local Contexts Labels and Notices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the cooperation between the two organizations, ORCID has become a Founding Supporter of Local Contexts, and Local Contexts has joined ORCID as a member organization. In coming months, Local Contexts and ORCID will be working to integrate the Local Contexts Hub with the ORCID registry, supporting the mutual linking of accounts for users of the two systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORCID is an open and interdisciplinary community-based effort to provide a Registry of Persistent Identifiers for all kinds of researchers, and tools for embedding these identifiers into research systems and workflows of research organizations, publishers and funders.</p>



<p>The mission of Local Contexts is to offer practical digital tools and frameworks, such as Labels and Notices, for Indigenous communities, cultural institutions, and researchers. Together with the Local Contexts Hub, these digital marks serve as essential tools to advance Indigenous data sovereignty and foster innovation. The primary objectives of Local Contexts are to support Indigenous decision-making and governance frameworks. These frameworks determine ownership, access, and culturally appropriate conditions for sharing cultural heritage and Indigenous data across historical, contemporary, and future contexts.</p>



<p>Stephany Runninghawk Johnson, Founding Executive Director of Local Contexts said:</p>



<p>“At Local Contexts we believe that Indigenous communities should be connected with their data. Working with ORCID to give researchers greater access to make and maintain those connections is really exciting and an opportunity to amplify Indigenous voices.“</p>



<p>Chris Shillum, Executive Director of ORCID said:</p>



<p>“One of ORCID’s three values is Inclusivity, so we are delighted to be working with Local Contexts to help researchers demonstrate that they respect the CARE Principles and support the rights of Indigenous Peoples to exert greater control over Indigenous data and and Indigenous Knowledge. “</p>



<p>_____</p>



<p><em>We acknowledge that ORCID is a US-based nonprofit organization incorporated in Bethesda, Maryland on the ancestral lands of the Piscataway people, the original stewards of this territory, and we recognize the ongoing legacy of their presence and culture in this region.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>However, as an organization with staff and a community that spans across geographic and national boundaries, ORCID acknowledges that many of the lands and waters we occupy are Indigenous Homelands. We recognize the ongoing significance of these lands and waters for Indigenous Peoples in the past, present, and future.</em></p>

</div></div>



<p>Like other PID infrastructure organizations, ORCID adoption continues to grow worldwide, and requests for access to data held in the ORCID registry are growing right along with it. Part of ORCID’s mission as a community-driven non-profit infrastructure organization is to ensure that ORCID data is made available freely and openly, and with as few barriers to access as possible, to anyone who might want to use it. We achieve this through the annual release of our public data file, as well as by providing our public APIs—both the Public (registered) and Anonymous APIs—which anyone may use free of charge to query and access all of the public data in the ORCID registry. These services are very well used. The public data file is typically downloaded many thousands of times a year, and our public APIs typically handle 100M–150M requests per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another key part of our mission is to ensure our sustainability. Our goal is to provide persistent identifier services, and we want to ensure that we are around for the long term to fulfill this promise. We are very grateful for the support of our 1,400+ organizational members who make it possible for us to financially sustain ourselves. In the spirit of equity, we also want to ensure that costs of supporting ORCID are shared fairly among our community, and that the heaviest users of our services shoulder their fair share of the burden. With ever-growing usage, we’ve been taking a close look at the patterns of access to our APIs in recent months, and have noticed that there are a small number of clients that are making a very large volume of calls, compared with the vast majority of more modest users. To help us manage this usage, we will be introducing some changes to the way that we manage API traffic in 2025.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:55%">
<p>Since the beginning, ORCID has had generous API Rate Limits (specifying the maximum number of requests per second that can be made by each API client) across all our APIs — Member, Public, and Anonymous. These serve primarily to maintain the health of our systems and to ensure excessive usage by one client does not impact access for everyone else. We now plan to implement new Usage Quotas in early 2025 (specifying the maximum number of requests that can be made in a day by each API client) for our Anonymous and Public APIs, as outlined further below. We will also be reducing the rate limit on those same APIs. The vast majority of API users will be unaffected by these quotas; we anticipate they will affect less than one percent of current Anonymous and Public API clients! As we will not be introducing a Usage Quota or changing the Rate Limit for the Member API, we do not anticipate any of our members will be impacted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-the-goals-of-enabling-access-to-orcid-data-with-our-long-term-sustainability">Balancing the goals of enabling access to ORCID data with our long-term sustainability</h2>


<p>When we began the process of considering changing the usage limits of our APIs earlier in the year, our goal was to encourage the small number of high-volume, sometimes commercial, users of our public APIs to share the in the costs of supporting them, while maintaining the lowest possible barriers to use for smaller-scale, often non-commercial integrations, in alignment with one of our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">10 founding principles</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“ORCID identifiers and record data (subject to privacy settings) will be made available via a combination of no-charge and for-a-fee APIs and services. Any fees will be set to ensure the sustainability of ORCID as a not-for-profit, charitable organization focused on the long-term persistence of the ORCID system.”</em>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier in 2024, we performed a detailed analysis of Anonymous and Public API traffic to accurately model the impact of various scenarios so that we could determine which one best met these dual goals. We collected several month’s worth of usage data for all clients that made over 1,000 API calls per day, clustering usage from similar IP address ranges of the anonymous API, as some parties appear to be accessing the API simultaneously from multiple servers in order to circumvent our current rate limit.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-ad2f72ca wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>Our analysis revealed that a handful of Anonymous API clients are generating the vast majority of API calls—80% of the total registry traffic—with some Anonymous API clients single-handedly making around 1M calls a day. These are the clients that will be primarily impacted by the new Usage Quotas. We discussed our analysis with the ORCID Board, reviewing various scenarios, taking into consideration strategic, risk, and equity implications of each. The Usage Quotas outlined below were approved by the Board at their September 2024 meeting.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="api-traffic-management-helps-orcids-community-contribute-equitably-to-our-sustainability">API Traffic Management helps ORCID’s community contribute equitably to our sustainability</h2>


<p>ORCID’s current Rate Limit is 24 requests per second for the Member, Public, and Anonymous APIs. There are currently no Usage Quotas for any of our APIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2025 we will begin to implement daily Usage Quotas and change the Rate Limit for the Public and Anonymous APIs as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>New API Limits</strong></td><td><strong>Anonymous API</strong></td><td><strong>Public (registered) API</strong></td><td><strong>Member API</strong>&nbsp;— Unchanged</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rate Limit</strong></td><td>12 req/sec</td><td>12 req/sec</td><td>24 req/sec</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Usage Quota</strong></td><td>25k reads/day<br>(Per IP address)</td><td>100k reads/day<br>(per Client ID)</td><td>No Usage Quota</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The Usage Quota for the Anonymous API will be rolled out in incremental steps over several months to give clients time to adapt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We anticipate that this will affect less than 50 of our Anonymous and Public API clients (out of 5,700 active integrations!). We will not be introducing a Usage Quota for our Member API, and the Rate Limit remains unchanged. This means that an ORCID Member organization taking full advantage of our current Rate Limit will still be able to make almost 2M requests per day, which is well above the usage patterns revealed by our analysis, so we don’t anticipate any of our members will experience disruption of any kind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ORCID will always provide our annual <a href="https://orcid.figshare.com/articles/dataset/ORCID_Public_Data_File_2024/27151305" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Public Data File</a> free to anyone who wishes to download it, however it&#8217;s crucial that we ensure fair and equitable access to the data found in the ORCID registry now and into the future. Reviewing our approach to API traffic management&nbsp; is one part of this. In October, we updated our “<a href="https://info.orcid.org/public-client-terms-of-service/" data-wpel-link="internal">Public APIs Terms of Service</a>” (formerly known as the “Public Client Terms of Service”) which further specify the terms of use for both our Public and Anonymous APIs. In it we:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clarified that the terms apply to both our Anonymous (non-registered) and Public (registered) APIs</li>



<li>Clarified the definition of ‘commercial use’</li>



<li>Explained that in addition to throttling, we may use rate limits or apply usage quotas to manage traffic to the Public APIs</li>



<li>Explained that you must adhere to our posted rate limits and usage quotas when accessing the Public APIs</li>



<li>Explained the circumstances under which we will agree to transfer your Public API credentials to your organization via the Member API</li>



<li>Clarified the circumstances under which you may use data obtained from the Public APIs for marketing communications, in order to comply with privacy regulations</li>



<li>Added a note regarding the status of translations of the Terms of Service</li>
</ul>



<p>We encourage non-commercial users of our Anonymous API whose usage is above 25k reads/day but below 100k reads/day to register for a free Public API key via their My ORCID page. This will enable us to better understand who is making high-volume usage of our APIs, and contact them if their usage reaches a level where it might impact other Public API users. For those organizations who make non-commercial usage of our APIs above 100k reads/day, and for all commercial API access, we encourage you to consider joining ORCID as an <a href="https://info.orcid.org/membership/" data-wpel-link="internal">organizational member</a>, which offers a host of other benefits, including real-time synchronization with the ORCID public data file, as well as API access with no Usage Quotas and a generous Rate Limit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By implementing modest Usage Quotas and adjusting the Rate Limit for Anonymous and Public API clients, we are confident that we will be able to maintain the integrity and availability of our services—even as demand grows—in a way that will ensure our long-term sustainability and facilitate our ability to grant equitable access to our data. If you have any comments or questions about the upcoming changes for users of the Public or Anonymous APIs, or updates to the Public API Terms of Service, please feel free to post in our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/orcid-api-users" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">API Users Group forum</a>.</p>

CERN is one of six institutional partners in the INSPIRE information platform (together with <a href="https://desy.de/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">DESY</a>, <a href="https://www.fnal.gov/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Fermilab</a>, <a href="https://www.in2p3.cnrs.fr/en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">IN2P3</a>, <a href="https://www.in2p3.cnrs.fr/en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">IHEP</a> and <a href="https://slac.stanford.edu/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">SLAC</a>), which has 25,000 daily users and 100,000 author profiles that connect with over one million articles and preprints relevant for their research.</p>



<p>For almost 50 years, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://inspirehep.net/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">INSPIRE HEP</a></span>&nbsp;has been the main information hub for the high-energy physics community that helps researchers share and find accurate scholarly information. In turn, INSPIRE HEP is integrated with ORCID with an OAuth sign-on that serves several purposes for researchers who use CERN and other facilities in high-energy physics research.</p>



<p>The following interview is with Micha Moskovic, the INSPIRE Product Manager.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-main-reasons-for-inspire-adopting-orcid"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the main reasons for INSPIRE adopting ORCID?</span></h3>


<p>When an author wants to make changes related to their INSPIRE author profile—such as submit a new paper or change anything on their profile in INSPIRE—they have to log into INSPIRE to submit content. This is in part to control Spam.</p>



<p>In 2018, INSPIRE HEP built an integration with ORCID in order to design useful services for high energy physics researchers. We use the ORCID OAuth sign-on, which requires users to have an ORCID record instead of us having local accounts with them. This allows us to know exactly who they are. It has an added benefit of promoting ORCID in the high-energy physics community because they are required to have an ORCID to submit content to INSPIRE or make modifications.</p>



<p>Additionally, we designed the integration to make it easy for researchers using INSPIRE HEP to populate their ORCID records. If the researcher gives us permission, then we will export all the works they have in INSPIRE to their ORCID record.</p>



<p>Increasingly, people are required to have their ORCID profile populated with information on their papers, so it’s good for our users to have an easy way to populate that information. INSPIRE hosts very large collaborations with thousands of people on it. The research papers have thousands of authors on them, so it would be unrealistic to report all of this manually.</p>



<p>We could have done many other services that have local logins, but because we want to incentivize the community to do the right thing, we want to have only the ORCID login.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inspire-s-integration-with-orcid-was-implemented-in-2013-has-anything-changed-over-time"><span style="font-weight: bold;">INSPIRE’s integration with ORCID was implemented in 2013. Has anything changed over time? </span></h3>


<p>Originally, we had just a single export of data from INSPIRE to ORCID users who had given us permission to add data to their records. When there was a new paper, we added it to their records, but it was just a one-time thing. So for every paper, if it had already been exported, then that was it and it was never exported again.</p>



<p>Then in 2018, we decided to have a different system where instead of having just the initial version exported, we continuously update the work, so that required some changes on our side.</p>



<p>The main reason for doing so is that we don’t have separate records for different versions of papers, but we have a single combined record for a preprint, which is very common in our field, and the published version. So if we just sent the initial version to ORCID when we created the record, it would often be a preprint and not a publication. The way we do it now is to reflect the latest version of records in INSPIRE.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-technical-or-communications-challenges-did-you-face-along-the-way-how-did-you-overcome-them"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What technical or communications challenges did you face along the way? How did you overcome them?</span></h3>


<p>We had some challenges with the data volume. At first we were sending every update to ORCID, which was way too much. I don’t know if we actually did that or if we planned to do it that way. We realized that was not going to work out because we would spam ORCID.</p>



<p>So we built something to determine whether the update on our record is relevant for ORCID because we have lots of metadata. If, say, a reference changes because we discover a new paper and we have a reference that will be linked to another paper, that’s a change from our perspective. But that’s not necessarily a meaningful change for ORCID. So now for every update on the INSPIRE side, we compute what it would look like in the ORCID version of the metadata, and we compare that with what we already sent. If that won’t change, then we won’t send the update to ORCID because it’s a change that is meaningful for INSPIRE, but not for ORCID.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-are-your-researchers-benefitting-from-your-contributing-data-to-their-records"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How are your researchers benefitting from your contributing data to their records? </span></h3>


<p>INSPIRE is a service for anyone in the world who is using it in the global high-energy physics community. They are benefitting because they can very easily have their ORCID record fully complete with all their works including things that are not published. With a typical integration they would not get their preprint added because they only add published papers. For research assessment purposes, authors have to provide their ORCID record, and this is tedious to do manually if you have hundreds of papers. Each paper can have thousands of co-authors. So providing this feature is very helpful because on the INSPIRE side, researchers just have to make sure their profile is clean and complete and then tick a box to export to ORCID and it will happen automatically.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-the-institution-utilizing-trust-markers-in-your-workflows"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How is the institution utilizing trust markers in your workflows?</span></h3>


<p>We don’t particularly rely on trust markers in our workflows the way other institutions might, as &nbsp;our goal is to build services that are useful to our end users, as opposed to utilizing records for any kind of assessment checks. However, we strongly encourage participants to get an ORCID record. And of course because we add the trusted data that we hold about our users to their records, that data is accompanied by a trust marker that can be reused in a number of different workflows..</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-has-orcid-adoption-grown-at-your-institution-what-activities-have-been-most-successful-in-fostering-adoption"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How has ORCID adoption grown at your institution? What activities have been most successful in fostering adoption?</span></h3>


<p>At CERN, ORCID adoption has grown because we have made efforts to get ORCID in a central place for the large experiments. Also, the new CERN account system has a field for registering ORCIDs, which our previous system didn’t have. And now when people register for a CERN account, we ask them for their ORCID.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeyOXvg424GUdV7zGxPABmBD4lAEly_swGmdpuGQtXquHuSd3OJpFbfXESTB9u0jRKmJa5NjatRtbibhHfwhhkr5Po2B_tpXH6slC_MsRq0EJBTImQYulfUPpFQBOzS7kfQkWqHig?key=ZMGTBnGye__T1X9ZNwZIuRBM" alt="The new CERN account system has a field for registering ORCIDs"/></figure>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-you-have-any-recommendations-you-would-like-to-share-with-other-research-institutions-or-organizations-that-are-planning-to-adopt-orcid"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have any recommendations you would like to share with other research institutions or organizations that are planning to adopt ORCID?</span></h3>


<p>At INSPIRE we have the same problem as others in the research world. We see a lot of papers, and there are authors on them, but the name and affiliation alone doesn’t tell you who the person is. Likewise, there are the same names that show up. ORCID solves this problem in a very good way through disambiguation, which is really a hard problem to solve without ORCID.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, everyone would have an ORCID because it’s a great tool for disambiguation and other things institutions typically care about, like knowing what research was done there. ORCID is definitely a part of solving the problems of identifying researchers and their outputs, and it is worthwhile to figure out what type of integration will be best for the institution.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-top-data-contributors-add-value-to-the-research-ecosystem"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Top data contributors add value to the research ecosystem</span></h3>


<p>In a healthy research ecosystem, anyone, anywhere should be able to correctly identify a researcher in connection to their publications, grants, and affiliations. Every institution involved in research bears part of the responsibility of strengthening their corner of the research ecosystem to ensure this possibility. By sheer volume alone, CERN, through the robust INSPIRE platform, is an example for how facilities can utilize ORCID to fulfill their own institutional requirements while also contributing rich metadata to ORCID records that can be propagated throughout the scholarly infrastructure. Like CERN and INSPIRE, ORCID member organizations can offer value to their community by requiring ORCID through a single sign-on integration.</p>

<p>Please join us in congratulating the successful candidates and welcoming them to the ORCID Board.</p>



<p>ORCID holds Board member elections for about a third of the board seats every year, following an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/nominations-now-open-for-orcid-board-elections-2025/" data-wpel-link="internal">open nominations process</a></span>. This year, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-nominating-committee/" data-wpel-link="internal">Nominating Committee</a></span>&nbsp;was chaired with great dedication by ORCID Board Member Heath Marks. The Committee reviewed&nbsp;eight valid nominations for the Member-Director Board seats and 48 valid nominations for the Researcher-Director seat. The slate put forward by the Nominating Committee has experience in the areas the Board identified as top priorities for this year’s nomination cycle:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Based in Asia and can advocate on behalf of ORCID in the region</li>



<li>Skilled in the areas of technology, cybersecurity, or finance</li>



<li>Members of one of the following stakeholder groups: publishers, vendors, or funders</li>



<li>Experience in organizational governance</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nominating Committee aimed to put forward a diverse slate of candidates driven by ORCID’s mission and inspired by ORCID’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/2020-2025-strategic-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">strategic themes</a></span>. The Committee was pleased to have nominations from candidates with the skills and experience specifically requested to better balance the existing Board this year. The Committee also ensured that the Board, as per our bylaws, retained a majority of representatives of non-profit members.</p>



<p>The Nominating Committee’s slate of candidates was reviewed by the Board at its September 2024 meeting, announced in this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/announcing-the-2025-board-slate/" data-wpel-link="internal">blog post</a></span>&nbsp;by Heath Marks, and sent directly to ORCID members via our newsletter and an email to all voting contacts in member organizations.</p>



<p>Of the 1,404 members eligible to vote in the 2025 Board elections, 423 (30.1%) cast votes, above the 10% participation threshold needed for the election to be valid. Of those members casting ballots, 400 (95%) voted in favor of the slate, 12 (2.9%) voted to abstain, and 9 (2.1%) voted against the ballot. Two additional members (.5%) noted that they chose to abstain from voting. The election results were certified at 21:06 UTC on 20 November 2024 and are available <a href="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Results-2.pdf" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<p>Please accept my thanks if you participated in the election, and join me in congratulating our new Board members on their election.</p>



<p>We also received an excellent and diverse set of applications to join our Researcher Advisory Council. These applications have been reviewed by staff and we will be extending invitations to the successful applicants in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________________</p>



<p>Disclosure of financial and non-financial relationships is critical to preserving and increasing trust in science and research. However, researchers and organizations have long struggled with the administrative burdens associated with both submitting and collecting disclosures. With no single system integrated within the broad span of research activities, the challenge of collecting complete and consistent disclosures has undermined efforts to increase transparency and trust in science.</p>



<p>The Convey system allows both organizations and individuals to leave behind outdated paper-based workflows as well as the awkward repurposing of existing systems, e.g. peer review, for disclosure collections. Built specifically for disclosure collections, Convey optimizes the experience for organizations through flexible disclosure policy management and for individuals by enabling reuse of some or all of their disclosure information for distribution to other organizations or groups.</p>



<p>The Convey&nbsp;disclosure collection system was developed by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to meet the need of its member institutions to make the process of submitting and collecting disclosures more efficient, more consistent, and meaningfully less burdensome. From its launch in 2018, Convey has supported both individuals who are submitting disclosures as well as the organizations and groups that are collecting the disclosures. However, Convey’s users now extend beyond AAMC member institutions to span the broader scientific community including societies and associations, publishers, and academic medical centers.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supporting-organizations"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supporting organizations</span></h2>


<p>Convey’s core subscriber base is made up of societies, associations, academic medical centers, and publishers. The system creates a fully electronic, consistent, and scalable disclosure process supporting subscribers that have less than 500 disclosures annually to those that have more than 50,000 disclosures collected annually. Convey has many integrations established with third-party systems introducing and optimizing automation into our subscribers’ disclosure workflows.</p>



<p>As a centralized repository for disclosures, the Convey system allows organizations to input their specific disclosure policies and rules for their communities and hand over the management of the disclosure collections process to the system. On the flip side, Convey also benefits individuals submitting disclosures, especially repeat users of the system, by providing them with an online interface that is secure and intuitive. Individuals can use Convey to disclose to requesting organizations OR they can use the system as a personal repository for disclosure information which can be distributed as needed in the default <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://convey.aamc.org/convey-discloser/#/icmje" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)</a></span> format. The Convey team is committed to meeting disclosers wherever they are in their scholarly life, strengthening standards in disclosure collections, and providing reasonable flexibility to optimize the disclosure collection workflow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeSNMVkArkj3E8ADio073vMefbeNfMJrK9kxMEFg5vL3wx4h_A9nwOA0vqz6uVBlGBtb5iSC4Y2A2poI8wGx6kOApbVIbbzhSe6sPQzye4xlJoVURudGFk3aBalcaufl5gS1xtYvw?key=8lSLtSrL1W220-IBIZhOAG70" alt="Screenshot of Policy &amp; Instructions on a disclosure form. "/></figure>



<p>Although the Convey system can support both organizations as well as individuals across market segments, the core of its users come from the scientific community. It is this core group of Convey users that motivated the development of an integration with ORCID. Through this integration, the Convey&nbsp;system strengthens the ability of its subscribing organizations to more quickly and confidently assess whether bias(es) and/or potential conflicts of interest exist by enabling a continuous thread connecting individuals with a persistent ORCID ID and all of their associated scholarly records and outputs.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-lightweight-integration"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A lightweight integration</span></h2>


<p>From a user perspective, connecting Convey and ORCID accounts is a simple process. When a researcher creates or updates their account on Convey.org, they are prompted to “Manage ORCID ID.” They can do this by clicking on a link to “Connect Your ORCID ID,” which leads to the ORCID login page. A successful login will result in the researcher’s ORCID ID auto-populating in their Convey account record.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdk-DhWT4VIpjlR1pi3Intuuvb1hyd8Yqo06J9-qcNrn3Nv7gzXFlewnp5FBmNxYW8LeF9Ck6Y8SV6jRsh3lmXXDC8-7lq3yJR7KVT4bDL3buvZaP3KpLrOlhE2rqqrbMnilA83?key=8lSLtSrL1W220-IBIZhOAG70" alt="Screenshot of Convey platform inside a disclosure agreement." style="width:840px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>For those researchers that initiate the disclosure process as part of a publishing workflow, Convey can also capture ORCID IDs via integrations with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/orcid-certified-service-providers-list/#manuscript-submission-systems" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID-certified Editorial Manager</a></span>&nbsp;system, as well as the eJournalPress peer review system. Publishers and societies licensing eJournalPress and Editorial Manager can enable the automated transmission of ORCID IDs to Convey. The Convey system will add the ORCID IDs to the account records of the discloser.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disambiguation-and-context-building"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disambiguation and context building</span></h2>


<p>ORCID solves the same problem in the disclosure process as it does in other research processes, specifically disambiguation of the researcher in a pool of other researchers, even from those with the same or similar name. Additionally, the link between ORCID and Convey allows evaluators of researchers’ disclosure information to quickly get a more complete understanding of their interests and research outputs in support of identifying—or ruling out—the existence of potential conflicts of interest.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supporting-researchers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supporting researchers</span></h2>


<p>Each year, researchers can spend up to 20 hours on disclosure submissions with one report showing that most of this time is spent entering basic information that is duplicated across disclosures. As a centralized disclosure collection platform, Convey greatly decreases the time that researchers spend by allowing them to reuse disclosure information across multiple organizations and disclosure events. This was particularly noticeable for one Convey user who had 210 financial interests to disclose.</p>



<p>The average initial disclosure in Convey takes 20 minutes, and this drops to 12 minutes for the second disclosure and continues to decrease as more financial interests are stored in the system, saving researchers many hours of work each year. Today, 25 percent of Convey’s users have used the system more than once.</p>



<p>Jonathan Schultz, the Director of Journal Operations for the American Heart Association (AHA) shares that “Authors who repeatedly use the system experience meaningful benefits when they come back to use it for additional manuscripts.”</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-increasing-trust-and-transparency-in-research"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Increasing trust and transparency in research </span></h2>


<p>Convey has integrated with ORCID to support the research community by enabling access to a more complete view of researchers and their research process. Convey is committed to embedding in the research ecosystem while also increasing transparency in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Consortia are integral to the success of ORCID, not just because they account for 77 percent of our membership, but also because they bring universities and organizations together in powerful communities of practice across 33 countries around the world.</p>



<p>Our operational model requires—and indeed the success of consortia depends upon—consortia lead organizations taking on the roles of local administration, as well as technical and outreach support to enable us to scale globally. The role that consortia lead organizations take in building and managing their national or regional <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-consortia-building-communities/" data-wpel-link="internal">communities of practice</a> is a key driver in ORCID’s successful uptake across the global research infrastructure.</p>



<p>ORCID’s membership agreements set the parameters of a successful partnership by outlining bi-lateral expectations—both what the member organization can expect from ORCID and vice versa. But the communities of practice that are formed afterward are key to ensuring ORCID member organizations reduce their administrative burden through ORCID, which is often best achieved through ORCID consortium membership.</p>



<p>Throughout the year, we also share and discuss ORCID and consortia-driven strategies, opportunities, challenges, and ideas with our consortia lead organizations in our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/consortia-interest-group/" data-wpel-link="internal">Consortia Interest Group</a> meetings and forum.</p>



<p>In-person workshops, like the one in Santiago, Chile, on 9-10 September—our first consortia workshop in Latin America—help us continue the information sharing, ideas exchange, and building on past work to <a href="https://info.orcid.org/a-look-at-the-past-to-strengthen-orcids-future-in-the-latin-american-and-caribbean-region/" data-wpel-link="internal">grow community in the region</a>.</p>



<p>In Santiago, Chilean consortium lead organization, <a href="https://www.cincel.cl/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">CINCEL</a>, hosted consortia leads from Chile, Brazil, Columbia, US, Denmark, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa at the <a href="https://dataobservatory.net/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">DataObservatory</a>. ORCID Board member participants from the USA, Australia, France, South Africa, and Canada also joined the workshop during the ORCID Board meeting.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reflecting-on-progress-and-future-directions">Reflecting on progress and future directions</h2>


<p>To kick things off, consortia leads, ORCID staff, and a number of <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-board/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Board</a> members, reflected on our growth compared to 2019. We now have 28 ORCID consortia, including one regional consortium, compared to 17 in 2019.</p>



<p>The group also reassessed the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-for-consortia/roles-and-responsiblities/" data-wpel-link="internal">Roles and Responsibilities of Consortia</a> and followed the analysis from a double session on consortium performance, challenges, directions, of each consortium&#8217;s future through group activities. A common theme that emerged was the importance of the consortia lead organization that understands the local research landscape to ORCID’s global reach.</p>



<p>Another big topic was ORCID’s revamped consortium member fee model, launched in 2022. This new model reflects organization size and funding. Next year, all organizations will be invoiced according to their operating budget worldwide.</p>



<p>Additionally, since ORCID is a conduit between the many systems that manage research, we analyzed our integration review protocol as part of the research infrastructure. We found that most individual researchers connect their ORCID ID at <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/orcid-certified-service-providers-list/#grantfacility-application-management-systems" data-wpel-link="internal">grant agencies </a>when initially applying for research funding, and/or a <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/orcid-certified-service-providers-list/#manuscript-submission-systems" data-wpel-link="internal">manuscript submission system for publishers</a>, then with a <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/orcid-certified-service-providers-list/#Research-Information-Systems" data-wpel-link="internal">CRIS/RIM system for their research institutions</a> to track their scholars’ output and <a href="https://info.orcid.org/repository-systems/" data-wpel-link="internal">repositories for preserving researcher output</a>. Enabling the common systems in this cycle to easily connect to ORCID eases the burden, both for member institutions and for researchers themselves.</p>



<p>Last but not least, we had a constructive exchange between consortia leads and Board members, where we discussed the challenges of keeping representative participation and meeting locations in a large world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-five-years-of-fruitful-exchanges-with-our-consortia">Five years of fruitful exchanges with our Consortia</h2>


<p>Five years ago, at the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-in-atlanta-our-second-consortia-workshop/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Consortium workshop co-hosted by Lyrasis</a> in Atlanta, we held a session called “Where will we be in 2025?” Since then, France, Ireland, Japan, US Federal Government Agencies, Ireland, Colombia, Chile, Ukraine, Latvia, Czechia, and Lebanon have all established ORCID consortia.</p>



<p>ORCID has provided new services to consortium member organizations that were not available in 2019, including the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/documentation/member-portal/" data-wpel-link="internal">Member Portal</a>, visual <a href="https://info.orcid.org/documentation/member-portal/member-reporting/" data-wpel-link="internal">member reports</a>, and the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/affiliation-manager/" data-wpel-link="internal">Affiliation Manager</a>. In a short time, the ORCID consortia community has grown and, in many cases, achieved self-sufficiency.</p>



<p>It is worth highlighting the role of <a href="https://orcid-lac.consortia.com.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Consortia</a>, which established a consortium in 2021 in Colombia, has emerged as the third largest consortium by member numbers. They are also a trailblazer by establishing the first multinational regional consortium, <a href="https://orcid-lac.consortia.com.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID-LAC</a>. Their excellent consortium leadership to members in Colombia, México, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru is one that showcases how the consortium lead model works best.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>


<p>In-person events are invaluable and would not be possible without the hard work and effort of organizations like CINCEL, which produced a great summary of hosting the ORCID Board meetings and the Consortium Workshop in <a href="https://x.com/consorciocincel/status/1835742512016732379" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">video</a> and <a href="https://cincel.cl/noticias/131-noticias-2024/714-chile-fue-anfitrion-de-encuentros-clave-de-orcid" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">news</a> format.</p>

<p>After we conducted workshop exercises about how a small non-profit organization can scale with the help of global consortium lead organizations, the consortium leads put forth possible action items.</p>



<p>In the following bi-monthly Consortium Interest Group meeting, workshop attendees and ORCID staff organizers Paloma Marín-Arraiza, Fran Alsina, Ana Cardoso and Brian Minihan worked with consortium lead organizations who were not able to participate in person to undergo similar processes.</p>



<p>We look forward to meeting in person again in February 2025, with appreciation to the Ludwig Maximilian Universität München for hosting!</p>

<li>Though ORCID is not yet ready to unequivocally adopt the POSI Principles, we acknowledge the importance of the initiative, as well as the conversations and collaborations generated by such a community-wide initiative</li>



<li>ORCID is eager to engage with the group of current POSI adopters and the broader scholarly infrastructure community to further evolve POSI in an open, transparent way</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<p>In 2015, a <a href="https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> was published articulating a new set of principles “by which open Infrastructures to support the research community could be run and sustained.” The authors espoused that the principles they set forth, called the <em>Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</em>, “could support the creation of successful shared infrastructures” by ensuring community governance, sustainability of funding and preservation of community ownership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the blog post, the authors noted that conversation and these principles had their genesis in the community concerns and discussions that led to ORCID’s creation, and noted that <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/#founding-principles" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID’s Founding Principles</a>, established by ORCID’s inaugural Board in 2010, “represented the first attempt to address the issue of community trust which have developed in our conversations since to include additional issues.”</p>



<p>In 2020, the Crossref board <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">formally adopted</a> and endorsed POSI, shortly thereafter followed by <a href="https://blog.datadryad.org/2020/12/08/dryads-commitment-to-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Dryad</a> and <a href="https://ror.org/blog/2020-12-16-aligning-ror-with-posi/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ROR</a>. Since then, 16 additional organizations have adopted the principles, making for a total of <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">19 current adopters</a>, the most recent adopting the principles this year.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-s-position-on-posi">ORCID’s position on POSI</h2>


<p>ORCID’s 10 Founding Principles stress openness, trust, and inclusivity, with no-charge access for researchers, who maintain full control of their data. We believe that ORCID’s strict adherence to our own Founding Principles, that center strongly on the concepts of community governance and researcher control, has been essential to winning the trust and participation of researchers themselves, and this in turn has been essential to the wide uptake and utilization of ORCID across the globe by researchers and institutions alike. Given the obvious similarities and historic links between ORCID’s Principles and <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/#our-values" data-wpel-link="internal">values</a> and POSI, we are asked from time to time about our stance on POSI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we are not yet ready to fully adopt the POSI Principles, as set out further below, we believe now is a helpful time to publish our self assessment against the POSI Principles in order to clarify our position and to encourage community discussion about how they can be further refined and improved. With this in mind, ORCID has undertaken a self-assessment not only of our own performance against the POSI Principles, but to compare them with the 10 Founding Principles that have guided our activities since the beginning of ORCID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our detailed self-assessment has confirmed our long-held belief that POSI is indeed broadly aligned with our own Founding Principles and values. While we agree with the “spirit” of nearly all of the POSI Principles, we have identified some inconsistencies between how certain POSI Principles are currently written, how most of the current POSI adopters have interpreted them, and how we operate. According to the POSI website, adoption of the POSI Principles is meant to be a “statement of intent” to comply with them, even if the organization is not fully compliant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At ORCID we take principles very seriously. Our own 10 Founding Principles were established very early in our history and have never changed — we view them as a cast-iron promise to our community about how we will conduct ourselves. For this reason, until we are comfortable that all of the POSI Principles are specifically expressed in a way that we can fully get behind, we feel unable to formally adopt them in their current form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are encouraged to learn from discussions with some of the current POSI adopters that they are starting to work on an update to both the POSI Principles and the accompanying FAQ. ORCID is eager to participate in these discussions and we stand committed to engage with the POSI adopters group and the broader scholarly infrastructure community in this work to further evolve POSI.</p>



<p>ORCID seeks to be as transparent as possible in taking decisions, and we strive to formulate policy with robust community input. We encourage the POSI adopters group to adopt a similar open and transparent approach to building community consensus around the next version of POSI. In our self-assessment, we have also included commentary about each of the principles which serves as our feedback to the POSI adopters, our suggestions about how they can be improved, and our questions about the way how they should be interpreted.</p>



<p>We invite you to review <a href="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ORCID-POSI-Self-assessment.pdf" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID’s POSI Self-Assessment</a>, and <a href="https://forms.gle/YhUtkiGAybjJbLTM6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reach out to us with feedback</a> if you wish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As chair of the Nominating Committee, I am delighted to announce the slate for ORCID’s 2025 Board election. As a community-built organization, ORCID is governed by a Board that is representative of its membership and wider community stakeholders. The ORCID Board fulfills an important role in the organization’s governance by providing strategic guidance and oversight for the successful achievement of ORCID’s mission. Our Board members are elected for three-year terms on a staggered schedule, so every year, we hold elections to appoint new members to the Board. More information is available in the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-charter/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Board Charter</a>.</p>



<p>The Nominating Committee received eight valid nominations for the Member-Director Board seats and 48 valid nominations for the Researcher-Director seat. Nominees had experience in one or many of the areas the board identified as top priorities for this year’s nomination cycle:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Based in Asia and can advocate on behalf of ORCID in the region</li>



<li>Skilled in the areas of technology, cybersecurity, or finance</li>



<li>Members of one of the following stakeholder groups: publishers, vendors, or funders</li>



<li>Experience in organizational governance</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nominating Committee considered each nomination carefully, striving to build a slate that would bring needed regional balance to the board and fill key sectoral gaps as directors rotate off the board.</p>



<p>I would like to thank all of the nominees this year for taking the time to put themselves forward for Board service. For those who were unsuccessful in making the slate this year, there are several other ways to participate in ORCID’s governance, such as committee membership.</p>



<p>I would also like to thank the members of the committee for their hard work and thoughtfulness throughout the process: Board Member Amal Amin Ibrahim (National Research Center, Egypt), Board Member Nicolas Fressengeas (Université de Lorraine), Board Member Kalynn Kennon (Infectious Diseases Data Observatory), Board Member Ellen Tise (Stellenbosch University), External Member Chris Chan (Hong Kong Baptist University), External Member Yasuhiro Murayama (National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Japan).</p>



<p>The Nominating Committee recommends the following nominees for election to the ORCID Board for the three-year term as per the bylaws.</p>

<p>Academic publishing is built upon an assumption of trust that, unfortunately, is increasingly at risk of exploitation by bad actors. With rising pressures and incentives for researchers to “publish or perish,” it is no wonder that there has been a rise in paper mills and academic misconduct in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consequences are significant: precious time and resources are wasted trying to validate and reproduce fraudulent results; those tasked with investigating academic misconduct are under increasing pressure; and public confidence in the ability of research to address the global challenges facing humanity has been significantly eroded.</p>



<p>Establishing trust in identities—allowing publishers to better know their authors—is an important step to regain confidence in processes and outputs, while showcasing the community’s commitment to high-quality, rigorous standards that ensure the right researchers get credit where credit is due. Often, a name and an email address are all it takes to become a potential author or a reviewer in the peer review ecosystem. By clearly identifying and linking researchers, in effect creating integrity-centric feedback loops between various systems, the research community can better trace patterns of behavior over time, making it easier to spot concerning trends, and reveal potential paper mills, citation rings, or unethical editorial practices.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wiley-and-orcid-longtime-collaborators">Wiley and ORCID: longtime collaborators</h2>


<p>Known and trusted in the community, and widely recognized as an industry standard, ORCID allows publishers to advance research integrity in a joined up, sustainable way. Wiley has been a member of and an instrumental partner of ORCID since 2012. In ORCID’s earliest days, Wiley provided foundational loans which were later graciously forgiven to support <a href="https://info.orcid.org/global-participation-program/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID’s Global Participation Program</a>, demonstrating their commitment to ensure the global exchange of knowledge in an equitable way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wiley currently has several integrations with the ORCID Registry, including Wiley &#8211; ScholarOne Manuscripts, Connect.science &#8211; Atypon, Authorea, Editorial Manager Journals at Wiley, and Wiley Author Services. Between these different touchpoints, Wiley has added more than 365,000 pieces of trusted data, making them one of ORCID’s top contributors of “trust markers” that can in turn be consumed by other external systems, such as funding systems, when researchers submit applications for grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More recently, Wiley developed <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/business/partner-solutions/solutions/research-exchange" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Research Exchange</a>, a seamless, all-in-one platform designed to efficiently manage submissions, integrity screening, and peer review, and currently supporting over 340 journals. Wiley was one of five pilot partners for ORCID’s <a href="https://info.orcid.org/summarizing-orcid-record-data-to-help-maintain-integrity-in-scholarly-publishing/" data-wpel-link="internal">Trust Markers Pilot Project</a> in 2023, which resulted in Wiley enabling Research Exchange users to access the validated identity information in ORCID Record Summaries across the submission journey and to be proactive when recognizing integrity issues.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trust-markers-help-users-of-orcid-data-visualize-provenance">Trust Markers help users of ORCID data visualize provenance</h2>


<p>When ORCID announced the Trust Markers program back in 2023, publishers were given a new tool—a Record Summary—to help their editorial teams make informed, contextualized choices when working with users. As one of ORCID’s launch partners for the project, Wiley quickly integrated Record Summaries into the publishing workflow at key touchpoints in the peer review-to-publication journey of their Research Exchange platform. All three Research Exchange modules (Submission, Screening, and Review) are directly integrated with ORCID, allowing users to link and authenticate their own ORCID iDs, screen and assess user Trust Markers in actionable and contextualized ways pre, mid-, and post-peer review, and get a better understanding of the identity and activity of other platform users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the context of an ORCID record, a <em>Trust Marker</em> is any item in that record that has been organizationally validated. In other words, information about that record holder’s affiliations, funding, or publications that have been added by an ORCID member organization (after having been granted permission by that researcher to add data to their record, of course). A <em>Record Summary</em> is an easy-to-read synopsis of all the provenance (i.e. source) metadata—including those accompanied by Trust Markers—found within the contents of the ORCID record. Record Summaries can be embedded into various workflows, such as manuscript and grant submission workflows. The hope is that this can reduce the burden on staff tasked with reviewing and vetting submissions, not to mention the effort on the part of authors and researchers themselves, as their data can automatically be ingested into these systems at the time of submission.</p>



<p>Provenance data has always been present in ORCID records. What’s new is the ability to&nbsp; easily visualize it with Trust Markers and Record Summaries. In a record with numerous Trust Markers, there may be fewer items that a reviewer or editor needs to double-check, when assessing an author’s scholarly bona-fides during the submission and review process.</p>



<p>ORCID records are commonly referred to as a “profile,” but because the data in them can be re-used by the 5,700+ external tools and systems that are integrated with ORCID, it might be more accurate to describe them as a <em>hub</em> of re-usable data. The data in those records gets propagated throughout all the scholarly systems that researchers interact with, creating integrity-centric feedback loops along the way; all while saving researchers huge amounts of time and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust is a scale that can change over time—“<em>is this author who they say they are&#8230; have they always been? Maybe that good actor is now considered a bad one&#8230; look what they’ve been up to over the last year?”</em> By establishing a sliding scale of trust, ORCID Trust Markers can help to tease out an evidence-based narrative around a user that’s centered around actual, verifiable activity, or scholarly bona-fides, over time.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="798" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C798&#038;ssl=1" alt="An example of a Record Summary" class="wp-image-29870" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C798&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=768%2C598&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1536%2C1197&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1320%2C1028&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-1.30.32%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=1964&amp;ssl=1 1964w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>It is critical to note that no matter how many Trust Markers there may be in any given ORCID record, there will always be perfectly good reasons why a researcher might self-assert data, and it is not ORCID’s role to make value judgements about the data contained within records. However, it is ORCID’s role to make the provenance of their data as clear as possible to understand, so that consumers of that data can more easily decide for themselves if it meets the requirements for their specific use case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the Trust Markers program is that it’s truly a community-driven solution, centered on the validated information that ORCID members contribute to researchers’ ORCID records. The more <em>trusted parties</em> in the community that contribute data to their researchers’ record—whether they be publishers like Wiley, or funders, or research institutions or universities—the more strong, responsible feedback loops there are to build robustness in the scholarly record as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building these feedback loops in-platform is key to the success of the Trust Markers program. Wiley’s Research Exchange has implemented these both to improve the quality of validated information whilst also making life easier for researchers to participate.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="embedding-trust-markersand-integritycentric-feedback-loopsin-the-submission-screening-and-review-processes">Embedding Trust Markers—and integrity-centric feedback loops—in the submission, screening, and review processes</h2>


<p>Publishers know that any process for establishing trust can be operationally costly. As with the implementation of any new process, careful planning is required to ensure information is seamlessly incorporated and easily interpretable by different users. It&#8217;s not enough to have the right data points; they need to be placed in the right context for users of a wide range of experience to get value from them. Interoperability and consistency across a myriad of <em>slightly</em> different systems makes this a challenge too. The Trust Markers found in ORCID Record Summaries—now embedded across all Research Exchange modules—are effective because they’re nuanced enough to recognize that different parties will interpret identity through differing lenses, but are clear enough to help users draw quick, human-led conclusions in-workflow without disrupting the editorial experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a publisher perspective, this helps pivot Wiley’s approach to identity recognition from being reactive to proactive—spotting issues early in the lifespan of a submission and preventing them becoming a problem further downstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers should receive credit for their work and peer review service in a way that other stakeholders across the publishing and scholarly ecosystem can recognize. Not only does this benefit the researchers themselves, but it also creates a feedback loop that can help drive the robustness of the entire scholarly record over time. As an early and ardent supporter of ORCID, Wiley has long contributed their trusted author data into ORCID records. Going forward, reviewers in Wiley journals will also be able to opt-in to directly add reviewer activity to their ORCID profile as well.</p>



<p>These feedback loops are beneficial to users at all points in their careers. For example, early career researchers with fewer publications to their name could update their record with institutional identifiers, but if that institution were to contribute that data on the researcher’s behalf, it could further establish firm grounding. Further, as peer review service can only be added by trusted organizations (in order to maintain the anonymity of reviews), publishers have a unique opportunity to “give back” to researchers—and support early career academics especially—by crediting them for their contributions during the publication process. Writing peer review service to ORCID records not only supports researchers, but it also benefits publishers and funders during the reviewer selection process, by helping them to select suitable reviewers based on their past service and expertise. Ultimately, by vouching for both identity and activity, publishers create additional layers of validation, as well as additional feedback loops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there is no one solution to fortify research integrity, it’s clear that the best way forward is together, and collaborations between open, persistent identifiers such as ORCID and publishers such as Wiley serve as an example as to how this can be accomplished. But there are plenty of opportunities for others across the scholarly ecosystem to participate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Institutions that are ORCID members, as well as service platforms or providers, have an opportunity—and indeed, a responsibility—to add the trusted data they hold about their researchers to their records, and to set up feedback loops with their organizationally-validated data that can help their users make carefully considered decisions across peer review and other scholarly workflows.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In recent years, the research world has shifted rapidly toward promoting the adoption of <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-fair-data-principles/" data-wpel-link="internal">FAIR data</a> and encouraging the use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for a more open and interconnected research ecosystem. While there are many different types of PIDs in use, there are generally considered five key PID types:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>PIDs for people, i.e. researchers and contributors (e.g. ORCID iDs)</li>



<li>PIDs for digital objects such as publications (e.g. DOIs)</li>



<li>PIDs for research activities (e.g. RAiDs),</li>



<li>PIDs for grants and funding awards (e.g. Grant DOIs) and</li>



<li>PIDs for research organizations (e.g. ROR IDs)</li>
</ul>



<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll discuss what ROR is, and why and how ORCID supports ROR, the Research Organization Registry as our preferred PID for organizations.</p>



<p>ROR hosts a global, community-driven registry that uniquely identifies organizations. This free and open PID service was launched in 2019 by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite, who jointly fund and govern ROR. ROR has since become an established and widely-adopted trusted PID service for identifying research organizations and currently includes more than 110,000 of them. ROR IDs and metadata are openly available under a CCO waiver, and ROR offers both a free-to-use REST Application Programming Interface (API) and a downloadable dataset of the entire registry.</p>



<p>ROR has become the standard identifier for organizations in ORCID records. Since <a href="https://ror.org/blog/2021-10-22-orcid-integrates-ror/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID adopted ROR in 2021</a>, more than 4.5 million ROR-associated affiliations have been added to over 3 million ORCID records, and the percentage of affiliations without identifiers in the ORCID Registry has dropped. Currently, about 80 percent of new affiliations created in ORCID are linked to ROR IDs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-compounding-benefits-of-ror-and-orcid">Compounding benefits of ROR and ORCID</h2>


<p>ORCID has been hard at work developing features that incorporate ROR into the ORCID user experience. This year, we launched a tool within the ORCID record that suggests an affiliation to new ORCID users by looking at the user&#8217;s email domain and matching it to an organization in ROR. This makes it easier than ever for new ORCID users to add an affiliation to their record. As a result, about 80% of newly created ORCID records now include an affiliation, significantly increasing the overall proportion of ORCID records with affiliation information.</p>



<p>ROR data has also helped us improve the accessibility of the ORCID Registry. In their new schema v2, ROR added support for multilingual names and acronyms, which we have incorporated into ORCID’s affiliation search feature, enabling researchers to search for their organizations in their own language.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;ORCID was a key player in the community collaborations that defined the early vision for ROR, and provides an important function today in enabling meaningful connections between researchers, organizations, and their outputs and activities. Supporting the exchange of open metadata across systems and the improvement of metadata at scale requires broad community participation, and we are pleased to collaborate with ORCID in these efforts,&#8221; said ROR&#8217;s Director, Maria Gould.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To help support the continued growth of this key PID provider, <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-increases-financial-support-for-ror/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID increased its financial commitment to ROR in 2023</a>. In 2024, ORCID is once again increasing financial support for ROR with a contribution of $150,000, adding to the core sustaining support provided by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite.</p>



<p>“ROR plays an important part in the broader open PID ecosystem, allowing institution names to be standardized and disambiguated and affiliations to be captured and linked to research outputs,” said ORCID’s Executive Director Chris Shillum. “Our continued financial support for ROR is a demonstration of our commitment to an open, interoperable PID infrastructure. We at ORCID feel it is our responsibility to help ensure that ROR remains sustainable for years to come to support the entire research community,”</p>

</ul>
</div></div>



<p><strong>We have recently released 2024 updates to our Privacy Policy.</strong></p>



<p>Privacy is and has always been a fundamental concern for ORCID. This is reflected in our founding <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">principles and values</a>, in our <a href="https://orcid.figshare.com/articles/online_resource/From_Vision_to_Value_ORCID_s_2022_2025_Strategic_Plan/16687207/1?file=30921316" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Strategic Priorities</a>, as well as in our day to day operations. Whether you are an ORCID record holder, an attendee at one of our events, a representative of one of our Member Organizations or a combination of the above, we want to make sure that we are clear about how and why we collect and use your personal information.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-up-with-significant-global-changes-to-privacy-regulation">Keeping up with significant global changes to privacy regulation</h2>


<p>ORCID regularly reviews how we use personal data to ensure that our ways of working are in line with our principles, the practices outlined in the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-trust/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Trust Program</a>, as well as meeting our legal obligations. Although the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/privacy-policy/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Privacy Policy</a> has been updated regularly since first drafted in 2012, the changes have mostly been incremental; the policy has never undergone a ground-up review until now. While our core personal data processing activities have not altered significantly in this time, several things have changed: there has been significant evolution in data protection regulations, the scope of our processing of personal data has expanded beyond just the ORCID Registry, and approaches to presenting privacy practices in a clear and understandable manner have also evolved. These developments, along with the appointment of ORCID’s first dedicated Data Protection Officer in late 2023, means it is now a good time to ensure ORCID’s Privacy Policy not only meets our legal obligations, but reflects current best practice in the provision of privacy information with a thorough re-write.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="our-revision-process-included-intensive-reflection-and-analysis">Our revision process included intensive reflection and analysis</h2>


<p>Revamping our Privacy Policy was a carefully considered process that involved members of every single team across ORCID’s staff. We began by comparing the information in our 2021 Policy with the personal data uses listed in our ROPA (Records of Processing Activities), created as part of a 2022 data protection review project, and other internal documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also reviewed the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as the transparency requirements of other national data protection laws that could affect ORCID and our community. Finally, we conducted a survey of privacy policies published by a range of other organizations in different sectors and countries, gathering examples of good practice and to generate new ideas for how best to present our new Policy in terms of clarity, layout, and content.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-want-orcids-privacy-policy-to-be-easier-to-understand">We want ORCID’s Privacy Policy to be easier to understand</h2>


<p>By nature, privacy policies are dry, information-heavy documents that are rarely engaging to anyone. There’s a lot of information to get across and different legal obligations to meet, but they fulfill an important purpose and our privacy policy is one way we demonstrate our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">Value of Openness</a>. To ensure as wide a readership as possible, we wanted ORCID’s Privacy Policy to be written in a way that is simple to read and understand, and logically structured to make it easier to navigate. It’s important to us that those reading the policy can quickly understand their rights and our approach to data protection and so we have given this information more prominence in the new version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During our review, we determined that some of the information in our 2021 policy belonged in other parts of the ORCID website. To improve clarity and reduce the length of the policy, we have moved the detailed privacy settings “how-to” information from the policy to our <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/25538671642519-Privacy-Settings" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">help pages</a>, where people can more easily find this type of guidance. We’ve also moved the information about how we deal with records of deceased persons <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360024829193-How-are-ORCID-records-for-deceased-people-handled#:~:text=What%20happens%20to%20the%20ORCID,set%20by%20the%20record%20owner" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="providing-comprehensive-data-protection-rights-regardless-of-location">Providing comprehensive data protection rights, regardless of location</h2>


<p>One area where we have made significant changes is in the presentation of information about people’s data protection rights. We realize that although ORCID is a US-based organization, we have a global community of users and members and there is specific information that our stakeholders in different countries expect to see. We wanted to make this as clear as possible so our stakeholders have confidence in how we approach our data protection obligations around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Policy confirms our position that, to the extent possible, we will extend the data subject rights found in the GDPR to everyone whose data we process, regardless of where they are located. Other privacy laws often include similar rights but they may not be as extensive as those found in the GDPR. As a US-based organization we have also added a handful of rights unique to emerging privacy regulations in various US States. By taking this approach, we aim to meet the highest level of privacy rights for all record holders and other stakeholders around the world.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comprehensive-coverage-of-all-of-our-personal-data-use-nbsp">Comprehensive coverage of all of our personal data use </h2>


<p>While our 2021 Policy already included detailed explanations of our personal data uses in the ORCID Registry and websites, it didn’t cover our uses of personal information related to support requests, mailing lists, membership administration, grant applications, or ORCID events and community engagement channels — services which have been added or extended since the original policy was drafted. These are now included in the revised version, structured according to the different data use scenarios in Section 6 (The data we use and why we use it) so the reader can quickly see what is and is not relevant to them, depending on their relationship with ORCID. Together with Section 5 (How and when we collect your data), we now describe all the ways we collect and use personal data when providing our services, and why we need the specific information in each of these cases.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="our-privacy-practices-have-not-changed">Our privacy practices have not changed</h2>


<p>Although the structure of our privacy policy is now somewhat different, almost all of the information that is in the 2021 Policy is either included in the new version or has been moved to the new Privacy Settings help page. We have not changed any of our underlying privacy practices as part of this rewrite. For ease of comparison we have completed a line by line comparison between the two Policies — the table in the attached document summarizes the changes made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="orcids-privacy-policy-review-process-includes-internal-and-external-stakeholders">ORCID’s Privacy Policy review process includes internal and external stakeholders</h2>


<p>Prior to publication, our new Privacy Policy was extensively reviewed by a number of different internal and external stakeholders: the ORCID senior team; our Board of Directors; specialized external privacy counsel; and ORCID’s legal counsel. It has also been assessed by TrustArc, our external privacy certification vendor, who certifies ORCID’s data protection processes against their TRUSTe Verified International Privacy program every year. This year we received recertification against the new policy and, consequently, confirmation that it meets the transparency standards defined in the EU–US Data Privacy Framework (even though as a non-profit organization, we are not formally eligible to participate in this program).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We invite you to review our updated <a href="https://info.orcid.org/privacy-policy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Privacy Policy</a> and learn about your data protection rights as an ORCID stakeholder. If you have any questions or concerns about ORCID’s privacy policy or these changes, please let us know by emailing privacy@orcid.org. </p>



<p>Thank you for your continued trust in ORCID!</p>

<li>Trust Markers can make things easier for publishers and funders to ensure the researcher they are reviewing is who they say they are</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<p>The scholarly community is collectively facing a looming crisis as more false research is slipping into publication, threatening the integrity of the scholarly record. At ORCID, we believe we have an important role to play in helping uphold the integrity of research, since the data in researcher-controlled ORCID records is shared widely and re-used within a growing number of scholarly workflows. ORCID records often contain “Trust Markers”—items in ORCID records that have been validated by one of our member organizations—such as validated affiliations added by universities and research institutions, validated funding awards added by funders, and validated works added by publishers. We discuss more about the concept of Trust Markers <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcids-community-trust-network-aims-to-elevate-trust-and-integrity-in-scholarly-record/" data-wpel-link="internal">in this presentation</a>. In short: The more Trust Markers are present in ORCID records, the more robust the entire scholarly record becomes as that data accumulates in an ORCID record and is shared with more and more systems.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we are delighted to share how we’re enabling researchers to add another kind of Trust Marker to their ORCID records—verified institutional email domains. This allows researchers to demonstrate their association with an institution in a way that also preserves their privacy. ORCID uses the domain information available in the ROR registry to map these email domains to the correct ROR ID for the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trust-markers-that-were-there-all-along">Trust markers that were there all along</h2>


<p>Thus far, the Trust Markers that are present in the ORCID Registry are there thanks to the efforts of hundreds of ORCID member organizations, who have integrated their internal systems and processes with ORCID. Other than researchers themselves, only ORCID member organizations are able to add data to ORCID records. This is by design: although ORCID is an open registry, meaning anyone can read and reuse data that has been made publicly available, only organizations who have agreed to our membership terms, which commit them to ensuring that data they add is factually accurate, are able to contribute information.</p>



<p>An exception to this rule is a kind of trust marker that has been in ORCID records all along, one that is added by researchers themselves—their institutional email addresses. Since verifying an institutional email requires the user to have authenticated access to their institutional email platform, we know that any users with a verified institutional email address have an association with that institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that less than 5% of ORCID users choose to make the email addresses on their ORCID records public, due to understandable spam and privacy concerns. Thus these latent Trust Markers, which have been there all along, are often not available to people using ORCID data to help evaluate the trustworthiness of the record holder.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-researchers-maintain-control-over-the-visibility-of-their-data">Researchers maintain control over the visibility of their data</h2>


<p>With this new update, ORCID users are able to separately control the privacy settings of the domain part of their email address—the part after the “@” sign that indicates the organization that administers the email address, from the full address. By making their verified email domains public, ORCID users can signify their verified association with their institution without having to compromise the privacy of their full email address.</p>



<p>Researcher control is a core principle of ORCID, and we offer fine-grained control over the <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/articles/360006897614" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">visibility</a> of the information in an ORCID record, and this remains true for email domains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this update, when a new or existing record holder verifies a new email address, the domain associated with it will inherit the default visibility setting for the items on their record. Normally this is set to “Everyone”, but the researcher can adjust both the default and the specific visibility settings of each email domain at any time via their account settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To respect researchers’ current privacy preferences, existing institutional email domains will inherit the visibility settings of the email addresses they are derived from, which is usually “Only me.”&nbsp; We plan to start prompting record holders to consider updating their settings to share their verified institutional domains later in the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="860" height="970" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emaildialoguebox.png?resize=860%2C970&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-29626" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emaildialoguebox.png?w=860&amp;ssl=1 860w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emaildialoguebox.png?resize=266%2C300&amp;ssl=1 266w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/emaildialoguebox.png?resize=768%2C866&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></figure>



<p>Validated email domains that you chose to make visible will show up on your public ORCID profile and in the Record Summary on your public profile, with the green “Trust Marker” checkmark. This helps viewers know that your record belongs to someone who is associated with a research organization, and that they can be more confident about its contents.</p>

<p>If you are an ORCID record holder with an institutional email address that has previously been verified, but the visibility setting is current set to “Only me,” we encourage you to sign in to ORCID and adjust the visibility settings in your ORCID record to allow either “Everyone” or at least “Trusted parties” to see your institutional email domain.</p>



<p>If your ORCID record does not yet contain your institutional email, add it, then verify it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, if possible, your ORCID record should include at least a personal email address as well as a verified institutional email address:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Personal email address:</strong> for continuity, in case you move institutions, to ensure you always have access to your ORCID record</li>



<li><strong>Institutional email address:</strong> for the Trust Marker</li>
</ul>



<p>We know that researchers sometimes prefer to use personal email addresses when submitting manuscripts to publishers and applying for grants, so that they can remain contactable even if they leave their current institution. By surfacing institutional email domains in ORCID records, we hope that publishers and funders who collect authenticated ORCID iDs in their submission processes will make use of this information, instead of forcing researchers to use their institutional email addresses as their correspondence addresses, which is increasingly the case today.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-trusted-data-in-orcid-records-more-visible-is-part-of-our-ongoing-work">Making trusted data in ORCID records more visible is part of our ongoing work</h2>


<p>When these changes go live later this week, the first thing users who have updated their visibility settings will notice are new verified domains—complete with the Trust Marker green check—included in the sidebar panel on the left of their ORCID record. We will then be rolling out further enhancements to the feature in coming months. In the shorter term, we will be including verified domains to the expandable Record Summary at the top of each ORCID record and in the Record Summary API. Next, we will be adding provenance information for verified domains, showing the date of verification and “ORCID Email Verification” as the source. As mentioned, we plan to start prompting record holders to consider updating their settings to share their verified institutional domains later in the year. Finally, in 2025, with the next major version of our API, we plan to add verified email domains to our main APIs as part of a larger update.</p>



<p>For the first time, this new capability allows researchers to add Trust Markers to their ORCID records even if their institution does not yet have a direct integration with ORCID (or use our Affiliation Manager tool). By doing so, they will be doing their part to uphold the robustness of the scholarly record, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since 2022, ORCID has given over $350K in funding to 20 organizations through our Global Participation Fund (GPF), a project of ORCID’s Global Participation Program (GPP), for the purpose of improving understanding and encouraging uptake of ORCID in under-represented countries in the Global South. Grants are offered under two different programs—Community Development and Outreach and Technical Integration.</p>



<p>Grants from the Community Development and Outreach program support local partners to build robust Communities of Practice, encouraging adoption of ORCID both by researchers and at the institutional level. These grants can be used to support local outreach activities, training, and tech support resources for the creation and growth of ORCID consortia that serve those regions.</p>



<p>Grants from the Technical Integration program can be used to fund software development to build and update ORCID integrations in open-source systems. This will foster participation in ORCID in currently under-represented regions and support the creation of technical documentation, outreach, and support for resources created through the grants.</p>



<p>To read more about how the GPF and the GPP fit into ORCID’s strategic priorities to increase global adoption of ORCID, especially in under-represented countries, we invite you to read <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.16687207.v1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">From Vision to Value: ORCID’s 2022–2025 Strategic Plan</a></em>.</p>

</ul>
</div></div>



<p>Centralized identity management policies and technologies allow institutions to grant users access to their systems with a single account that authenticates users into a centralized system. Once authenticated, users can then access other systems without needing to use separate credentials. These systems might include Course Management Systems, Research Information Management systems, Human Resources systems, repositories, and other internal systems and apps, and in some cases external systems as well.</p>



<p>This practice of centralizing identity management has been developed over the last 20 years and adopted by an increasing number of universities and research institutions in the quest to increase security and provide a more seamless and productive workspace. For institutions that already have a strong centralized identity management policy and infrastructure, implementing ORCID at this level can be a more streamlined approach than managing multiple ORCID integrations into many local systems. Institutions that integrate ORCID into a centralized system can save time and financial resources while fast-tracking ORCID adoption amongst researchers at any stage of their career.</p>



<p>Stanford University is one example of a university that chose to integrate ORCID into its centralized identity management system, which it did to comply with US research security directives issued by the National Security Presidential Memorandum-33, better known as NSPM-33. Stanford University offers an ideal case study for similar research institutions that already have a centralized system and want to compound the benefits of ORCID membership across campus.</p>



<p>This blog details the ways that Stanford’s ORCID integration is benefitting the university and how other institutions can follow suit.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stanford-s-gateway-to-research-security">Stanford’s “gateway” to research security</h2>


<p>Among the mandates of NSPM-33 is the establishment of research security programs at research institutions receiving federal funds. The guidance says that digital persistent identifier (DPI) services, also known as persistent identifier (PID) providers, must “support secure integration with standard authentication services, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and Open Authentication (OAuth).” It is worth noting that ORCID is the only PID provider for individuals that meets the requirements outlined in the NSPM-33 guidance.</p>

<p>Zach Chandler, Director of Open Scholarship Strategy at the Stanford Data Science Initiative, was part of a multi-disciplinary team co-led by Tom Cramer, Associate University Librarian at Stanford University tasked with integrating ORCID into the Stanford University Network Identifier (SUNetID). The team comprised staff from Stanford Data Science’s Center for Open and REproducible Science (CORES), Stanford University IT, Stanford Libraries, and Stanford School of Medicine. Together they built the Stanford-ORCID gateway and app that pairs ORCID iDs with a local Stanford unique ID through an OAuth workflow.</p>



<p>When new users log into the gateway, they&#8217;re routed to ORCID to first claim an ORCID iD, which is then returned to Stanford along with a persistent token that allows the university to update users’ ORCID records on their behalf through Stanford’s ORCID member API.</p>



<p>“We leveraged the ORCID public API to build the portal for Stanford Researchers to link their SUNetID to ORCID iDs, enabling ease of use and data flow now and in the future,” said Sangeetha Chowhan, MaIS Technical Manager at Stanford.</p>

<p>The linking between ORCID and Stanford University’s centralized system is set up as a self-service process, which allows users full control to access the portal and change permissions related to linking, reading, or writing data to their ORCID record.</p>



<p>Zach added that there are over 1,100 faculty that have done this so far. “We have a growing corpus to build from so that now in any downstream system that work is available,” he said. “We aspire for 100 percent adoption across all fields of study at Stanford.”</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-alternate-path-to-orcid-integration">An alternate path to ORCID integration</h2>


<p>Centralized systems such as the one at Stanford University are using methods of Federated Identity Management (FIM), which enable a user’s identity to be linked across a variety of separate identity management systems. FIM allows users to move securely and quickly between systems. </p>



<p>A centralized system has a front-end where users sign in, and a back-end directory, often implemented using the Light Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is a database containing all the core attributes of the users, such as username, name, department, status, whether they’re faculty, staff, or student, and other key details.</p>



<p>“Once authorized and linked by users, their ORCID iDs are fetched and then stored in Stanford’s LDAP,” said Sangeetha. “Integrated ORCID iDs are available and accessible via LDAP and Registry Web Services, subject to data owner approvals.”</p>



<p>By integrating with ORCID, the centralized system can also add authenticated ORCID iDs into that directory. Doing so allows administrators of the institution’s other internal systems to very easily pull authenticated ORCID iDs out of the central directory without having to do local ORCID integration. In this way, a centralized ORCID integration provides an alternate path to integrating ORCID into multiple different systems at a university.</p>



<p>At Stanford University, the ORCID iD is stored in LDAP as an eduPerson identifier and released as part of the SAML attributes, which then becomes available to any web-based application that can authenticate through single sign-on and gets the SAML attributes as a default value.</p>



<p>In addition, the access tokens provided by ORCID when the user links their Stanford and ORCID profiles are also stored in LDAP and are available for reuse via an internal Stanford API. This means that the permission that Stanford has obtained to update their researcher’s ORCID records during the account linking process can be used by any Stanford system without having to obtain further permission from the user.</p>



<p>For example, Stanford’s institutional repository uses these tokens to update ORCID records with research data deposits as &#8220;Works&#8221; in ORCID. Writing data deposits to ORCID records is an important step in acknowledging research data as scholarly work. </p>



<p>In another example, the Stanford Profiles system is able to use the tokens to push confirmed publications that have been added to researchers&#8217; Stanford Profiles page to their ORCID profile automatically.</p>



<p>Universities that have ORCID IDs stored in source systems like Stanford can also release them as SAML metadata to non-Stanford external systems that offer sign-in via the Stanford credential, which could have valuable follow-on effects and gets the research community closer to the &#8220;DPI Services&#8221; outlined in NSPM-33.</p>

<p>The advantages for universities taking a centralized approach to integrating with ORCID are threefold:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It&#8217;s net less work to integrate ORCID centrally,</li>



<li>The university gives users the opportunity to link or register their ORCID iD as part of the enrollment process, which leads to a higher compliance rate than trying to encourage the institution’s researchers to separately link their ORCIDs into different contexts, and</li>



<li>It helps universities integrate data for analysis and insight generation.</li>
</ul>



<p>If the institution has both internal and external datasets that contain ORCID iDs, then they have a set of links between those two datasets that they can use to integrate at a later time.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-centralized-strategy">A centralized strategy</h2>


<p>ORCID seeks to bring value to any workflows or processes that universities have. Sometimes it makes sense for institutions to seek separate ORCID integrations for its different local systems. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>However, with the increasing prevalence of centralized identity management, it is worthwhile for administrators to consider seeking strategic gains from integrating ORCID into a central system, such as seen at Stanford.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“Most universities have identity management processes, but it varies as to how strategic they are,” said ORCID’s Executive Director Chris Shillum. “There are good reasons for centralized identity management. Users hate to have to remember multiple account credentials, and there are numerous security benefits. In terms of integrating with ORCID, an institution might otherwise have to integrate, say, five different systems separately, can do one integration through a central identity management system that can be used by all its other systems, reducing the total technical effort involved and avoiding users having to link their ORCID IDs in multiple places.”</p>



<p>Other universities can integrate with ORCID centrally and reap the same benefits that Stanford University did. At Stanford, integrating ORCID into a centralized identity management system not only helped the institution meet guidelines set by NSPM-33, it also provided downstream benefits to other Stanford systems—all with less work and cost than separate integrations. Whether the goal is improving research security, improving workplace productivity, or gaining institutional insights from new data, institutions with a centralized system should consider this approach to ORCID membership.</p>



<p>When research institutions integrate their systems with ORCID, they more easily stay up to date with the research produced at their institution, while making researchers’ lives easier.

<p>At the time of writing, there are 130 million works in the ORCID registry attached to 5.8 million researchers, including journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, datasets, and software artifacts. Works are added to ORCID records in two distinct ways: automatically, when added by an ORCID member organization; or manually, by the researcher adding the work themselves. However they are added, an important element of the metadata associated with works is the work type, which is critical to allow the re-use and interoperability of the work data in the ORCID registry.</p>

<p>Many work types that are important in humanities and arts disciplines are currently not well represented in the ORCID registry, so ORCID is not as useful as it might be to researchers in those fields. </p>



<p>ORCID invites <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSctmBsPhTd4HiTAO9Ke0b3-8G_Ux5WpiDdSnReD_7I/edit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">community input to our discussion</a> as we develop our policy and process around including new work types.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>For interoperability and quality purposes, whenever possible, ORCID aims to adopt external community standards for controlled metadata vocabularies that are maintained by groups of experts. When ORCID was first launched, we adopted the CASRAI vocabulary for work types. Unfortunately, however, the CASRAI initiative was not sustained, and it is no longer maintained as a stand-alone vocabulary. </p>



<p>Over the years, we added several work types to the ORCID registry in an ad-hoc manner to support our community&#8217;s needs, including: software, pre-prints, annotations, data management plans, reviews, and physical objects. While useful in the short-term, this resulted in the ORCID work type vocabulary drifting out of alignment with community standards. More significantly, many work types which are important in humanities and arts disciplines are missing from the current vocabulary, meaning that these works are currently not well represented in the ORCID registry and ORCID is not as useful as it might be to researchers in those fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to address these deficiencies, we are now developing an updated, community-validated policy for which work types we support, why we support them, and a documented mechanism for new additions to be considered. We are proposing to expand our work type vocabulary and map it to a subset of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) resource types list, while taking care to maintain backwards compatibility with our current vocabulary.</p>

<p>Last month, a handful of ORCID staff attended PIDfest, a festival of Persistent Identifiers, which took place at the National Library of Technology in Prague, Czech Republic. Previously, the PID community convened at PIDapalooza, which went virtual in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. PIDfest 2024 was the first time the festival brought PID organizations together in person since 2020.</p>



<p>In addition to presentations on the serious matters of PID infrastructure, ORCID hosted a table for making fun ORCID-themed friendship bracelets! We enjoyed connecting with the PID community and look forward to the next PIDfest.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“There was a marked difference in tone between the last time everyone met in person, and this year’s PIDfest,” said ORCID’s Director of Communications, Julie Petro. “Back then there was still a bit of uncertainty about how to best articulate the value of a PID infrastructure, and it seems like we were still working out how to help our wider community understand that adopting PIDs in their systems and processes could benefit them. A lot of it was still theoretical. This year it seems like the community has moved past that—everyone seems to understand the value of PIDs much better now, and the conversations seemed to center around how various PIDs are being used specifically, and what the plans are for the future.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Below is a roundup of sessions hosted by ORCID staff with links to the presentations when available.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pid-providers-keynote-delivering-value-to-the-research-sector"><strong>PID providers keynote: Delivering value to the research sector</strong></h3>


<p>The PIDfest keynote panel included ORCID Executive Director Chris Shillum and representatives from other PID providers to address how the community delivers value to the research sector. Other panelists included Jonathan Clark, DOI Foundation; Helena Cousijn, DataCite; Shawn Ross, ARDC; Natasha Simons, ARDC Chair; and Maria Gould, ROR/DataCite. <a href="https://repozitar.techlib.cz/server/api/core/bitstreams/1975d087-25ad-4d61-9d99-5b70abdc99f6/content" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Download the presentation here</a>.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-s-multi-faceted-approach-to-increasing-global-adoption">ORCID’s Multi-faceted Approach to Increasing Global Adoption</h3>


<p>During this session by ORCID’s Grant Program Officer Lombe Tembo, she discussed what we have done over the past few years to build momentum for global uptake of ORCID and the revitalization of several founding partnerships to develop the Global Participation Fund (GPF). The GPF awards grants supporting the development of local expertise and communities of practice, and we have recently wrapped up our fourth round of awards.</p>



<p>Tembo also discussed developing new partnership models with organizations that have both local knowledge and resources, our new, re-tooled membership tiering model with an eye toward equity, and how we launched a new regional consortia model to allow smaller countries to benefit from communities of practice in their regions. <a href="https://repozitar.techlib.cz/server/api/core/bitstreams/00ec80d4-2702-4dc8-a62f-1f8c048b13f7/content" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Download the presentation here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-pids-demonstrate-identity-and-why-that-s-better-for-research-integrity-than-verification">How PIDs Demonstrate Identity and Why That’s Better for Research Integrity than Verification</h3>


<p>In this session, ORCID’s Executive Director Chris Shillum, Director of Communications Julie Petro, and Product Director Tom Demeranville asked participants to reframe the issue of identity verification and consider a more robust way to uphold and improve research integrity in scholarly workflows: identity demonstration. Those might sound like the same thing, but there are key differences. They discussed how difficult it is to verify actual human beings in a global context. Other topics include how identity verification is a concept rooted in centralized, gatekeeper-based systems, while identity demonstration is built over time—like a reputation—bit by bit, with (ideally PID-enabled) validated data contributed by multiple sources. <a href="https://repozitar.techlib.cz/server/api/core/bitstreams/0711a939-6708-46f7-8455-7faead52b7b3/content" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Download the presentation here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pidifying-latin-america">PIDifying Latin America</h3>


<p>Ana Cardoso presented on the primary open PIDs used in research, as well as demonstrating how they are being used in the Latin America region and how, in combination, they can increase trust in research and the research infrastructure. She discussed the benefits of persistent identifiers used in Latin America and how their adoption contributes to open science and a more open and robust framework that strengthens the research ecosystem. She shared case studies and their benefits with the interoperability of the different open persistent identifiers. <a href="https://repozitar.techlib.cz/server/api/core/bitstreams/5470b6ee-2e8c-45f5-9251-4e5665a8f289/content" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Download the presentation here</a>.</p>

<p>In our inaugural ORCID in the Wild webinar series—which aims to showcase ORCID case studies from around the community—we featured Vanessa Fairhurst, Chad Sansing, and Chris Wilkinson from PREreview, along with special guest Anna Hatch, PhD, from Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>



<p>PREreview offers open preprint reviews for all researchers. The platform exists to help systematically disadvantaged scientists engage in peer review to make science and scholarship more equitable, transparent, and collaborative. PREreview recently launched an ORCID integration that gives researchers the ability to link their open preprint reviews to their ORCID records.</p>



<p>If you missed the webinar, you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/953938858?share=copy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">catch the replay</a> here and <a href="https://orcid.filecamp.com/s/o/Gr984AtGjOCEnbMY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">download the presentation</a> here.</p>



<p><strong>Webinar Highlights</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>PREreview offers researchers open preprint peer reviews in direct response to key issues within the traditional peer review process.</li>



<li>PREreview is aligned with ORCID’s values of openness, trust, and inclusion.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Open</strong> – PREreview’s open platform helps it achieve as much transparency as possible and is non-proprietary.</li>



<li><strong>Trust</strong> – Users log into the peer review platform via ORCID, which builds trust with the community and clarity in research contributions.</li>



<li><strong>Inclusion</strong> – Contributions to peer review via PREreview are barrier free, extending the pool of reviewers to those traditionally excluded.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-s-vision-for-a-more-accessible-registry">ORCID’s vision for a more accessible Registry</h2>


<p>Accessibility aligns with <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID’s vision</a> of a world where all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions across disciplines, borders, and time. Additionally, accessibility also aligns with one of our core values, inclusivity, as well as our second founding principle of transcending discipline, geographic, national, and institutional boundaries.</p>



<p>One of our core <a href="https://orcid.figshare.com/articles/online_resource/From_Vision_to_Value_ORCID_s_2022_2025_Strategic_Plan/16687207/1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">strategic objectives through 2025</a>, and likely beyond, is increasing global participation, which is not limited to overcoming geographical boundaries. “Global participation is far more than just geography,” said Dineen who has spearheaded ORCID’s accessibility improvements. “It’s about participation in all manner.”</p>



<p>In short, Dineen said that ORCID believes that ORCID should be open and accessible to all in order to serve the global community and move toward our vision. “We should be working toward making ORCID accessible to anyone, regardless of their ability, their status, their location, or the way that they access ORCID,” he said.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-s-accessibility-audits">ORCID’s accessibility audits</h2>


<p>According to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), for an online technology to be accessible, it must be, “designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.” To align with this initiative, an accessibility audit in 2022 served as a catalyst for ORCID to begin the ongoing work of making significant accessibility improvements within the ORCID Registry using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) accessibility standard 2.1 guidelines.</p>



<p>After engaging the <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Digital Accessibility Centre</a> in Wales, UK, for the audit, we learned that we had 67 accessibility issues across our eight key journeys that we asked DAC to focus on:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>View/navigate a public record</li>



<li>Register a new ORCID account</li>



<li>Add some personal info (Biography)</li>



<li>Add an employment affiliation</li>



<li>Manually add a work</li>



<li>Use Search &amp; Link</li>



<li>Navigate an established private record</li>



<li>Sign in / Sign out</li>
</ul>



<p>To prioritize a plan of action, we focused on making accessibility improvements to the ORCID record, for both Public and Private views. We set out to improve accessibility by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Restructuring ORCID records to ensure more logical structure and flow.</li>



<li>Redesigning the key forms in the Registry to be coherent, and accessible.</li>



<li>Overhauled the visibility widget and selection process to make sure changes of state were proactively communicated to users.</li>



<li>Optimizing our QA testing with automated accessibility tools .</li>



<li>Last, we worked with the Comms team to develop an accessible ORCID brand color palette.</li>
</ul>



<p>In early 2023, we conducted an internal assessment to make sure that we were on track. Our review showed that we&#8217;d fixed more than half of the 67 issues listed in the first audit report. We resolved a vast majority of Level A and AA issues, specced out the remaining issues and added them to the backlog pending further investigation. While the numbers seemed to suggest the work we had done to improve the ORCID record was a quantifiable success we still couldn’t be certain that the changes we had made were enough. Meeting the WCAG criteria point-for-point doesn’t always translate directly into an accessible user experience. We needed DACs insight once again.</p>



<p>Our second audit was intended to be validation of the work we had done to remediate the issues raised in the first audit. Although we&#8217;d learned loads, some issues still remained. Results showed 88 issues across four categories in the WCAG 2.2 guidelines, which was released in late 2023. Even though some rules and criteria changed between 2.1 and 2.2, fortunately, we had anticipated this and planned our issue comparisons and prioritization accordingly. Again, we set out to work prioritizing these categories to continue moving forward in our work.</p>



<p>Our progress so far shows that the registration and sign-in processes are much improved<br>and have made good progress with 3rd party widgets that we had added since the first audit. We will link to existing work in the outstanding accessibility tasks in the backlog so they are done organically as part of ongoing feature development.</p>

<p>Accessibility improvements to the ORCID Registry represent a work in progress after many hours of assessing, prioritizing, and executing on our plan of action. Our backlog of accessibility improvements will include small improvements, tweaks, tidy-ups and fixes, as well as a handful of larger tasks, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visible focus styles: Finding a way to clearly and consistently show the user what they are currently interacting with</li>



<li>Timeouts: Warn idle users before we automatically sign them out of the Registry and give them a chance to cancel the timeout before it happens</li>



<li>The ORCID homepage: Long due for an overhaul, we expect our new home page to be published soon, and we’ve ensured it will be as accessible as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2022, the Kenya Libraries and Information Services Consortium (KLISC) received a Community Development and Outreach grant in ORCID’s first cycle of Global Participation Funds (GPF) to train librarians and research directors for increased adoption of ORCID in universities across Kenya. At the close of their grant funding, KLISC has reported positive outcomes from their activities.</p>



<p>“We are tremendously pleased with the progress made by GPF awardees to increase ORCID adoption in the Global South, where ORCID participation has traditionally been lower,” said ORCID Executive Director Chris Shillum. “The grant activities executed by KLISC promote learning and build awareness and energy about ORCID that provide a strong foundation for establishing an ORCID Community of Practice. We are happy to highlight KLISC’s efforts and look forward to seeing continued growth of ORCID adoption in Kenya.”</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stakeholder-empowerment-through-training">Stakeholder Empowerment through Training</h2>


<p>KLISC initiated several key activities to achieve their goal, targeting key stakeholders such as university librarians, heads of research, and systems librarians with three different workshops: Trainer of Trainers, Advocacy and Training for Directors/Heads of Research, and Advocacy Training for Systems Librarians.</p>

<p>This workshop equipped 22 university head librarians from universities across Kenya with the skills to train their respective researchers on registering for an ORCID record and optimizing their records to relieve their burden and save them time as they conducted their research activities. The head librarians themselves were trained on how to populate and utilize their researchers’ records—with their permission.</p>



<p>The training resulted in a new active community of practice for ORCID TOTs, and KLISC members continue to engage with one another on the best practices to advocate for ORCID adoption, celebrate milestones on advocacy efforts, and share and network.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="creation-of-an-orcid-online-tutorial">Creation of an ORCID Online Tutorial</h4>


<p>KLISC commissioned resource experts to develop an <a href="https://klisc.or.ke/publications/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID Implementation Guide</a> aimed at assisting librarians during ORCID training sessions within their respective universities. These guides serve as valuable references for facilitating similar workshops. Additionally, the tutorial was made accessible to KLISC members through the consortium&#8217;s website and shared through the TOTs community of practice WhatsApp channel.</p>



<p>This successful project resulted in multiple beneficial outcomes, including laying a foundation for increasing ORCID adoption, improved web visibility, and enhanced research networking. The workshops with various stakeholders served to increase awareness and utilization of ORCID identifiers and empower them with the necessary skills and knowledge to promote and utilize ORCID identifiers effectively within their respective institutions.</p>



<p>“The journey with the GPF project was nothing short of transformative,” said Dr. Penninah Musangi, University Librarian Amref International University in Kenya and GPF PI. “It not only empowered KLISC’s more than 30 institutions to streamline researcher identification, but it has also significantly enhanced collaboration and visibility in the global research community.”</p>



<p>Musangi added that by encouraging and ensuring that faculty, researchers, students, and contributors to journals create and maintain their ORCID records, KLISC has been able to enhance the discoverability and accessibility of the scholarly outputs and research activities of Kenyan researchers.</p>



<p>“The support and resources provided by ORCID throughout the project period have been pivotal in driving and achieving our mission forward, resulting in more visible and identifiable research outputs,” she said. “This success story is a testament to the power of strategic funding and dedicated teamwork in achieving meaningful progress.&#8221;</p>



<p>The project promoted the adoption of ORCID identifiers in Kenyan universities and the integration of ORCID identifiers within institutional workflows. Despite facing resource constraints and institutional challenges, the project increased visibility and collaboration opportunities for researchers within the Kenyan academic landscape.</p>



<p>The project organizers also hope to expand on this success by offering training sessions in all four regions of Kenya. ORCID looks forward to seeing this project continue to expand and grow ORCID’s adoption in the Kenyan research community.</p>

<p>One of ORCID’s major initiatives in 2023 was to plan and execute the transition of the ORCID Registry to a new hosting provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The migration project, which was completed in January 2024, allows ORCID to take advantage of AWS’s capabilities for cloud hosting and managed services, while eliminating our previous reliance on a single physical data center.</p>



<p>With state-of-the-art cloud hosting, we immediately improved the resilience of our services. For example, in the event of technical outage at the hosting center, ORCID’s web services will still run seamlessly because our systems are now spread across multiple data centers in different buildings (AWS availability zones), which is marked improvement from our previous risk of single-facility failure.</p>



<p>“After 10 months of very careful preparation, we moved the hosting of the ORCID Registry to Amazon Web Services, and there are a whole range of benefits with that,” said Will Simpson, Director of Technology. “We’re already much more resilient to outages, and we continue to work on security and resilience.”</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-benefits">Long-term benefits</h2>


<p>For the longer term, ORCID will be able to increase use of AWS-managed cloud services and so spend less time managing servers and more time delivering value to researchers and member organizations. We are already using AWS Elasticache for in-memory distributed caching in the Registry to improve performance in the UI and APIs. We are currently working toward using AWS Relational Database Service to reduce recovery time in the event of a failure of our core Registry database.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the migration to AWS will make it easier for ORCID to reduce risks, improve resilience, and spend more resources improving our services and functionality for researchers and members.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The scholarly community is collectively facing a looming crisis as more false research is slipping into publication, threatening the integrity of the scholarly record. Members of the ORCID Senior Team recently devoted a webinar to address how ORCID, and more specifically ORCID member organizations, can help. If you missed the webinar, you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/949243297?share=copy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">catch the replay here</a> and <a href="https://orcid.filecamp.com/s/o/OiWi2foRLFz4gFOE/GXj8mSBvSKIWb54l/o9CY1mOTbiYSW4pL" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">download the presentation here</a>.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-multilayered-approach">A Multi-layered Approach</h2>


<p>At ORCID, we recognize that multiple factors contribute to the crisis in research integrity, including the “publish or perish” pressure that researchers face to advance in their careers, shifts in publishing industry business models through the Open Access transition, some of which risk incentivizing publication volume and speed over quality, and the rise of generative AI tools that reduce the effort it takes to create plausible “fake” research.</p>



<p>“I don’t think there’s any one solution to this problem,” said ORCID Executive Director Chris Shillum. (<a href="ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1108-3660" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1108-3660</a>) “The community needs to take a multi-layered approach.”</p>



<p>This multi-layered approach can be visually explained through the “Pyramid of Trust” (itself adapted from the “Triangle of Trust”, presented earlier in the year at NISOPlus 2024 by Anita De Waard, VP Research Collaborations at Elsevier.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The model describes the multiple layers of validation that should be considered when verifying research outputs. At the base of the pyramid is research integrity and ethics. When a research output can be verified as real, written by identified human researchers with track records and whose conflicts of interest are known, then it allows for a basic foundation of trust to be able to move up the pyramid.</p>



<p>“We believe that knowing who researchers are is an important part of the solution, and this is where ORCID has a key role to play,” said Shillum. But “knowing your researchers” isn’t as simple as it might seem, and solutions that seem straightforward might not work for this use case, for several reasons. For example, a typical government ID, while it validates identity, could be difficult to validate at an international scale, and could be intrusive from a privacy point of view. Instead, we believe that the use of validated aspects of a researcher’s scholarly activities is better suited to a research integrity context because it allows a researcher to demonstrate identity through their professional bona fides.</p>



<p>“We think that things like academic affiliation, their educational record, their previous funding awards, and their previously published works correlate much more strongly with sifting out the good actors from the bad actors, and this is generally information that people make public as part of their scholarly work,” said Shillum. Fortunately, our Community Trust Network allows trusted organizational members of ORCID to add these kinds of information to researchers’ ORCID records, always with the researcher’s permission. We call these organizationally validated items on ORCID Records &#8220;Trust Markers.&#8221;</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="trust-markers-in-orcid-records-can-help-with-a-number-of-issues">Trust Markers in ORCID records can help with a number of issues</h2>


<p>ORCID’s Product Director Tom Demeranville (<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0902-4386" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0902-4386</a>) explained that every item in an ORCID record includes provenance metadata, and items added by member organizations, the Trust Markers, are accompanied by an indicator that highlights that that data came from a validated source. “We really appreciate when research organizations add validated affiliation information to ORCID records,” he said. “Similarly, when publishers add outputs and reviews, that’s really useful. And it’s great when funders add funding information to ORCID records. Together, these validated assertions elevate the level of trust in the system as a whole and benefit everyone else in the community. What we’ve realized is that the level of trust in a record accumulates over time.”</p>



<p>To help visualize trust markers more clearly, ORCID has recently developed a record summary view that can be embedded into various workflows, such as manuscript and grant submission workflows, that surface the trust markers that accompany data asserted by validated sources. The hope is that this can reduce the burden on staff tasked with reviewing and vetting submissions, not to mention the effort on the part of authors and researchers themselves, as their data can automatically be ingested into these systems at the time of submission.</p>



<p>In other words, the trust markers that are present when an ORCID member organization has added a piece of data to an ORCID record start to add up, making it easier to validate the identity of the researcher and their outputs.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="orcids-organizational-members-together-form-our-community-trust-network">ORCID’s organizational members together form our Community Trust Network</h2>


<p>ORCID’s Community Trust Network is about elevating trust and integrity across the entire research ecosystem. It depends on every organization in the community taking their share of ownership and responsibility for contributing the authoritative data that they hold about researchers in their corner of the research world.</p>



<p>Even though a lot of people refer to their ORCID records as a “profile,” the data in well-populated ORCID records can be re-used by the almost 5,700 external tools and systems that are integrated with ORCID. So ORCID behaves more like a hub of re-usable profile data. ORCID’S Director of Communications Julie Petro (<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4967-747X" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4967-747X</a>) explained, “Whatever data is in those records gets propagated throughout all the scholarly systems that researchers interact with, saving them huge amounts of time and effort. This is why it’s so important for us to help our members and other consumers of ORCID data understand more clearly the provenance of that data.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>“Trust markers are present in the ORCID Registry thanks to the efforts of hundreds of ORCID member organizations, because, other than the researchers themselves, only ORCID member organizations are able to add data,” said Petro. This is by design: though ORCID is an open registry, meaning anyone can read and reuse data that has been made publicly available, only organizations who have agreed to our membership terms of service, which commit them to ensuring that data they add is factually accurate, are able to contribute information.</p>



<p>Over time, as more and more members of our Community Trust Network—ORCID member organizations—add validated data to the ORCID Registry, the more trust markers there are in the data, and the more robust the entire scholarly record becomes.</p>



<p>To learn more about how ORCID members are already using trust markers, <a href="https://vimeo.com/949243297?share=copy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">watch the recording</a>.</p>

<p>Petro reminded participants that no matter how many trust markers there are in an ORCID record, “there will always be perfectly good reasons for researcher to self-assert data: perhaps the organization they are affiliated with doesn’t contribute data yet, or doesn’t exist in the same form anymore, or they’re recording an historical output.”</p>



<p>No matter the reason, ORCID is committed to making it as easy as possible for our member organizations to contribute their trusted data, reducing the need for researchers to add the data themselves. ORCID members benefit from dedicated technical support to assist with integration development or trouble shooting. Other integration accelerators, like ORCID’s Certified Service Providers (CSPs) allow for quick adoption of ORCID with systems that adhere to community-developed best practices for different workflows. This ensures a more consistent user experience for researchers, and ORCID members who use these systems can be confident they are using best practice ORCID integrations to easily add trusted data to their researchers’ records.</p>

<p>We are encouraged that the notions of cumulative trust and trust markers are beginning to make their way outside of the ORCID community and the larger PID community. ORCID members have a unique opportunity to contribute high-quality data directly to the records of the researchers they are affiliated with, publish, or fund. By doing so, they become active participants in our Community Trust Network—playing an important role in repairing and elevating trust in the scholarly record. the scholarly record.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m pleased to announce that nominations for ORCID’s Board of Directors are now open. As a community-built organization, ORCID is governed by a Board that is representative of its membership and wider community stakeholders. The ORCID Board fulfills an important role in the organization’s governance by providing strategic guidance and oversight for the successful achievement of ORCID’s mission. Our Board members are elected for three-year terms on a staggered schedule, so every year, we hold elections to appoint new members to the Board. More information is available in the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-charter/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Board Charter</a>.</p>



<p>This is your opportunity to participate in ORCID’s governance and we are asking for your help.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nominating-committee-amp-elections-process">Nominating Committee &amp; Elections Process</h2>


<p>The ORCID Board nominations process gives ORCID members a direct voice in the organization’s direction and priorities. Our annual <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-elections/" data-wpel-link="internal">elections</a> are an important part of ORCID’s commitment to open and transparent stakeholder governance, and the election process ensures that ORCID grows and develops in close partnership with its members.</p>



<p>All ORCID member organizations are eligible to nominate a representative to stand for election to serve as a Member-Director on the Board. In addition, two seats on the Board are reserved for Researcher-Directors who are practicing scholars and do not need to be affiliated with an ORCID member organization.</p>



<p><strong>This year, we are looking to fill up to four Member-Director board seats. To apply to be a Member-Director, you must be affiliated with an <a href="https://orcid.org/members" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID member organization</a>.</strong></p>



<p>As this year’s Chair of the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-nominating-committee/" data-wpel-link="internal">Nominating Committee</a>, I look forward to working closely with the other Committee members on this process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chris Chan, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong (External Member)</li>



<li>Nicolas Fressengeas, Université de Lorraine, France (Board Member)</li>



<li>Amal Amin Ibrahim, National Research Center, Egypt (Board Member)</li>



<li>Kalynn Kennon, University of Oxford, UK (Board Member)</li>



<li>Yasuhiro Murayama, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, (Japan (External Member)</li>



<li>Ellen Tise, Stellenbosch University, South Africa (Board Member)</li>
</ul>



<p>The role of the Nominating Committee is to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>select a ‘slate’ of candidates that is balanced and diverse</li>



<li>ensure that all of the skills needed to govern the organization are present among Board members</li>



<li>ensure that the many different sectors and regions that make up ORCID’s community are represented</li>



<li>Ensure the ORCID bylaw requirements are met in that a majority of Board seats are occupied by not-for-profit organizations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Annual reports and other governance information is available on our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/" data-wpel-link="internal">Governance web page</a>.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="qualifications-and-expectations">Qualifications and expectations</h2>


<p>Supported by the Executive Director and a full-time professional staff, the ORCID Board is responsible for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing and regularly updating ORCID’s strategic plan</li>



<li>Reviewing high-level organizational goals and policies to support that plan</li>



<li>Overseeing ORCID’s organizational and financial performance</li>



<li>Ensuring ORCID has financial resources to achieve its mission</li>



<li>Monitoring Board function</li>



<li>Appointing the Executive Director and reviewing their performance</li>



<li>Serving as a community advocate for ORCID</li>
</ul>



<p>More information about the Board’s role and responsibilities can be found in the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-charter/" data-wpel-link="internal">Board Charter</a>.</p>



<p>If elected, new Board members will serve for a period of three years, starting in February 2025. Board Directors are expected to attend all board meetings—currently there are four meetings a year, two virtual, and two in person—and to play an active role in ORCID activities during the course of their term, including serving on one or two Board committees.</p>



<p> All meetings are conducted in English and applicants mustbe fluent in English. </p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2025-selection-criteria">2025 Selection Criteria</h2>


<p>Each year, our Board establishes criteria for the selection of new Board members in order to maintain the balance of skills necessary to govern the organization, and to ensure diverse representation from ORCID’s stakeholder communities. This year, in seeking perspectives and skills complementary to those of continuing Board members, the Nominating Committee will be specifically looking for candidates who meet one or more of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Are based in Asia and can advocate on behalf of ORCID in the region</li>



<li>Are skilled in the areas of technology, cybersecurity, or finance</li>



<li>Are members of one of the following stakeholder groups: publishers, vendors, or funders</li>



<li>Have experience in organizational governance</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="time-commitment">Time Commitment</h2>


<p>In-person Board meetings typically last two days and take place in February and September. The meetings are hosted by member organizations in different regions across the globe. Board members are expected to travel to attend in-person board meetings. To help achieve our goal of broad representation across sectors and regions, a Board Meeting Attendance Fund is available to reduce financial barriers to participation in Board meetings for those Directors whose organizations are unable to support their travel costs.</p>



<p>Virtual Board meetings take place in May and November and are four hours each. Virtual Board meetings are split across two days to best accommodate the wide range of time zones on our global Board. This means meetings may take place outside of your standard working hours.</p>



<p>In addition to attending Board meetings, Board members are expected to serve on one or two Board committees each year. With the exception of the Executive Committee, Board committees generally meet virtually four times a year. Meetings tend to be one hour and may be held outside of your normal working hours due to the time zone constraints of other committee members. More information around committee roles and responsibilities can be found in the committee charters listed on our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/" data-wpel-link="internal">governance page</a>.</p>



<p>Board members are responsible for reviewing meeting materials and making substantive contributions to the work of the Board and its committees.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>


<p>Please nominate yourself, encourage a colleague to apply, or nominate another individual (with their permission), using our nomination form:</p>

We strive to have a Board that reflects our diverse community and we encourage individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to apply to serve on the Board.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-dates">Key Dates</h2>


<p>We will consider all nominations received by 28 June 2024. The slate will be presented to the current Board for approval at its September meeting, after which it will be announced publicly. Our voting members then have the choice of either voting for the slate or proposing additional candidates (within 30 days of the slate being announced), in which case the election will become a plurality vote by candidate. To propose additional candidates, a group of 20 or more member organizations must submit a nomination in writing to ORCID before 30 October 2024. Note that the group may not include more than one member per consortium (for specific details, see Article III, Section 2b of <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/bylaws/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID’s Bylaws</a>). We will send notifications and open the election by electronic ballot on 31 October 2024.</p>

<p>I am excited to share two exciting opportunities for researchers to become involved in ORCID’s governance: serving as a Researcher-Director on ORCID’s Board of Directors and serving on the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/orcid-researcher-advisory-council/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Researcher Advisory Council</a>.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="researcherdirector-seat-on-the-board-nominations-now-open">Researcher-Director Seat on the Board &#8211; nominations now open</h2>


<p>ORCID is governed by a Board of Directors that is representative of its membership and wider community of stakeholders. The ORCID Board is responsible for ensuring the organization is acting in the best interests of ORCID&#8217;s community by providing strategic guidance and oversight for the successful achievement of <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID’s mission</a>.<br><br>ORCID Board members are elected for three-year terms on a staggered schedule, so every year, we hold elections to appoint new Directors. Two Researcher-Director Board seats are reserved for practicing scholars, irrespective of their ORCID member affiliation. <strong>This year, we are looking to fill one Researcher-Director Board seat.</strong></p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="board-responsibilities">Board Responsibilities</h2>


<p>Supported by the Executive Director and a full-time professional staff, the ORCID Board is responsible for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing and regularly updating ORCID’s strategic plan</li>



<li>Reviewing high-level organizational goals and policies to support that plan</li>



<li>Overseeing ORCID’s organizational and financial performance</li>



<li>Ensuring ORCID has financial resources to achieve its mission</li>



<li>Monitoring Board function</li>



<li>Appointing the Executive Director and reviewing their performance</li>



<li>Serving as a community advocate for ORCID</li>



<li>Researcher-Directors also serve as co-chairs of the ORCID Researcher Advisory Council, and serve as a link between the Council and the Board.</li>
</ul>



<p>If elected, new Board members will serve for a period of three years, starting in February 2025. Note that ORCID Board members serve as uncompensated volunteers. All Board meetings are conducted in English and applicants must be fluent in English.<br><br>For more information about the role of ORCID Board members, please see the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/board-charter/" data-wpel-link="internal">Board Charter</a>. Our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/annual-reports/" data-wpel-link="internal">annual reports</a> and other <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/" data-wpel-link="internal">governance information</a> are also available on our web site.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2025-board-selection-criteria">2025 Board Selection Criteria</h2>


<p>Each year, our Board establishes criteria for the selection of new Board members in order to maintain the balance of skills necessary to govern the organization, and to ensure diverse representation from ORCID&#8217;s stakeholder communities. This year, in seeking perspectives and skills complementary to those of continuing Board members, the Nominating Committee will give preference to researcher representative candidates who display one or more of the following characteristics:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Are early or mid-career researchers enthusiastic about ORCID</li>



<li>Can advocate on behalf of ORCID in their communities</li>



<li>Have experience or a keen interest in organizational governance</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="board-time-commitment">Board Time Commitment</h2>


<p>Board Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings—currently there are four meetings a year, two virtual, and two in person—and to play an active role in ORCID activities during the course of their term, including serving on one or two Board committees.<br><br>In-person Board meetings typically last two days and take place in February and September. The meetings are hosted by member organizations in different regions across the globe. Board members are expected to travel to attend in-person board meetings. ORCID covers the travel costs for the Researcher-Directors to attend in-person Board meetings.<br><br>Virtual Board meetings take place in May and November and are four hours each. Virtual Board meetings are split across two days to best accommodate the wide range of time zones on our global Board. This means meetings may take place outside of your standard working hours.<br><br>In addition to attending Board meetings, Board members are expected to serve on one or two Board committees each year. With the exception of the Executive Committee, Board committees generally meet virtually four times a year. Meetings tend to be one hour and may be held outside of your normal working hours due to the time zone constraints of other committee members. More information around committee roles and responsibilities can be found in the committee charters listed on our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/our-governance/" data-wpel-link="internal">governance page</a>.<br><br>Board members are responsible for reviewing meeting materials and making substantive contributions to the work of the Board and its committees.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="orcid-researcher-advisory-council-orac-nominations-now-open">ORCID Researcher Advisory Council (ORAC) &#8211; nominations now open</h2>


<p>Although the ORCID Board has long had two seats reserved for Researcher-Directors, the Board focuses on organizational governance and cannot represent the full breadth of the researcher community. To ensure that we keep the researcher at the center of everything we do at ORCID, the Board created the ORCID Researcher Advisory Council (ORAC) in 2021. ORAC is a diverse group of researchers who provide valuable perspective and advice to ORCID staff and the ORCID Board as we seek to ensure that ORCID provides value and utility to researchers and aids in the process of research and innovation.<br><br>Council members meet virtually twice a year. These meetings are generally an hour long; due to the wide distribution of timezones may take place outside of your standard working hours. In between meetings, Council members are invited to participate in an online forum to discuss and consult on topics as they arise. Council members serve for a two-year term.<br><br>All meetings are conducted in English and applicants must be fluent in English.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>


<p>If you are interested in serving on the Board or ORAC, you may nominate yourself or a colleague (with their permission) by completing our nomination form.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>Nominations must be received by <strong>28 June</strong>.</p>



<p>All applications received will be reviewed by the ORCID Nominating Committee which is responsible for developing the Board election slate based on the nominations received, taking into account this year&#8217;s selection criteria as indicated above, and maintaining a majority of representatives of non-profit organizations on the Board as required by ORCID&#8217;s bylaws. Please note that the Nominating Committee may follow up with you after you submit your application to schedule an interview, complete a board skills survey, or ask follow-up questions.<br><br>If you are unable to complete this online form, please send your responses to <a href="mailto:nominations@orcid.org">nominations@orcid.org</a>.<br>As an organization, we are committed to <a href="https://info.orcid.org/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-at-orcid/" data-wpel-link="internal">diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)</a>. We strive to have a Board and Council that reflect our diverse community and we encourage individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to apply to serve.<br><br>If you have specific questions about board service, ORAC, or the nominations process, you can email us at <a href="mailto:nominations@orcid.org">nominations@orcid.org</a></p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-dates">Key Dates</h2>


<p>We will consider all nominations received by 28 June 2024. The slate will be presented to the current Board for approval at its September meeting, after which it will be announced publicly. Our voting members then have the choice of either voting for the slate or proposing additional candidates (within 30 days of the slate being announced), in which case the election will become a plurality vote by candidate. To propose additional candidates, a group of 20 or more member organizations must submit a nomination in writing to ORCID before 30 October 2024. Note that the group may not include more than one member per consortium (for specific details, see Article III, Section 2b of ORCID’s Bylaws). We will send notifications and open the election by electronic ballot on 31 October 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We recently shared ORCID’s efforts to expand communities of practice in Latin America in our blog <em><a href="https://info.orcid.org/a-look-at-the-past-to-strengthen-orcids-future-in-the-latin-american-and-caribbean-region/" data-wpel-link="internal">A Look at the Past to Strengthen ORCID’s Future in the Latin American and Caribbean Region</a></em>. We continue to make strides to grow a region- and sector-based community of practice approach, driven by our network of partners and consortia, which ties into one of ORCID’s four strategic priorities outlined in <em><a href="https://info.orcid.org/2020-2025-strategic-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">From Vision to Value: ORCID’s 2022–2025 Strategic Plan</a></em>—Increasing Global Participation.</p>



<p>In this blog, we will highlight the efforts of the ORCID-Chile Consortium formed by <a href="https://www.cincel.cl/iniciativas/ina" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">CINCEL</a> in 2022, which brought together 17 higher education institutions plus a government agency (National Research and Development Agency‚ <a href="https://anid.cl/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ANID</a>).</p>



<p>In March 2024, the ORCID-Chile consortium celebrated two years of operation. During this time, it has made important progress in two main areas: the implementation of integrations and improving communication with their consortium members.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implementation-of-integrations">Implementation of integrations</h2>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="288" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-1.png?resize=512%2C288&#038;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of Chile's CRIS system" class="wp-image-28089" style="width:397px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-1.png?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-1.png?resize=285%2C160&amp;ssl=1 285w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<p>One of the main goals of the consortium is to facilitate the adoption of ORCID by the Chilean scientific community. To this end, it has worked on implementing integrations with research-relevant systems and platforms, such as research information systems (mainly CRIS), manuscript submission systems (e.g. OJS), and repository systems (e.g. DSpace). Since June, their technical staff has worked closely with member institutions that requested technical advice and, in coordination with technical support from ORCID, increased the number of their integrations from 12 to 28.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="362" height="512" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-2.png?resize=362%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="Integraciones en uso" class="wp-image-28092" style="width:324px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-2.png?w=362&amp;ssl=1 362w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-2.png?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></figure></div>


<p>In this area, the consortium has made significant progress. In 2023, 73% of their members took advantage of ORCID’s <a href="https://info.orcid.org/affiliation-manager/" data-wpel-link="internal">Affiliation Manager</a>—the consortia-only tool that allows ORCID consortia members to add affiliation data to ORCID records without the need for technical integration. The University of Concepción completed four integrations (see table), the ANID institutional repository (repositorio.anid.cl) allows authentication using ORCID iD (see image) and six institutions implemented integrations with DSpace. </p>



<p>These advances have allowed Chilean researchers to create and maintain their ORCID records more easily and efficiently. For example, integrations with DSpace allow researchers to link their ORCID records to their research data automatically.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focus-on-communication"><strong>Focus on communication</strong></h2>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="288" src="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-3.png?resize=512%2C288&#038;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of a phone with Chile's consortium info showing." class="wp-image-28093" style="width:413px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-3.png?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-3.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chile-3.png?resize=285%2C160&amp;ssl=1 285w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<p>The consortium has also worked with a focus on communication with consortium members. To this end, it has implemented a communication plan that includes the dissemination of information through various channels, such as newsletters, social networks, and dissemination at academic meetings. Activities such as the resources provided by ORCID and the monthly statistical reports have been very useful.</p>



<p>In 2022, the consortium launched a monthly newsletter (<a href="https://cincel.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b6a705b0a20378525ef65a63d&amp;id=7144a0ef21" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">subscribe here</a>) that shares information about ORCID, reports on progress, and promotes technical advice. In addition, there is continuous participation in meetings on open science, reflecting the adoption of persistent identifiers in the Chilean academic ecosystem.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-challenges-and-opportunities">New challenges and opportunities</h2>


<p>In the near future ORCID-Chile already sees new challenges and opportunities. María Soledad Bravo-Marchant, executive secretary of Consorcio CINCEL, was elected as an ORCID <a href="https://info.orcid.org/announcing-the-results-of-orcids-2024-board-election/" data-wpel-link="internal">Board member for the period 2024-2027</a>, thus contributing to Latin American representation in this body. Likewise, a short-term objective is to exceed 20 members and provide them with the support they need to facilitate the adoption and use of the ORCID identifier by the Chilean scientific community.</p>



<p>Members in 10 of the 16 regions of Chile are already taking advantage of the benefits of being part of this ORCID community of practice. And the Chilean consortium would like to invite more institutions to join them and enjoy <a href="https://info.orcid.org/membership/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Premium and Consortium Membership benefits</a>, which grants five member API credentials, technical support, training, among others. If your institution is interested, we invite you to contact: <a href="mailto:secretariaejecutiva@cincel.cl">secretariaejecutiva@cincel.cl</a> for more information or to request the incorporation of your institution to the consortium.</p>

<p>ORCID’s Enabling Value series showcases how ORCID-certified service providers enable fast and simple registry interoperability for ORCID member organizations and other scholarly institutions. If you missed our most recent Enabling Value webinar featuring Erik Hanson, a system developer with <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Public Knowledge Project</a> (PKP), you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/927983661?share=copy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">watch the replay here</a>.</p>



<p>PKP is a research and development project that creates and supports open infrastructure to improve the quality, reach, and diversity of scholarly publishing. In this webinar, Hanson covered two of PKP’s open source ORCID-integrated products, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and Open Preprint Systems (OPS). ORCID is integrated within the editorial and workflow processes of both OJS and OPS, which allows users to validate users’ ORCID iDs as part of the publication process.</p>

Additionally, it allows users to manage all aspects of the production process, including substantive editing copy, editing, layout and galleries, and the collection of articles, editorials, and reviews into issues for publishing online in a mobile, friendly website. These features make it the world&#8217;s most widely used open source journal publishing software platform, available in over 50 languages.</p>



<p>Similarly, OPS is an open source preprint server software that allows researchers to upload data sets, revise papers before publications, and link the final published work. OPS users can invite scholars, and share preprints and research data, through an easy submission wizard. It also allows researchers to post frequent updates as they accumulate data. Finally, it allows for the distribution of preprints.</p>



<p>“As a <a href="https://info.orcid.org/upgraded-certified-service-provider-program-now-available/" data-wpel-link="internal">pilot partner</a> for the revamped <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/become-an-orcid-certified-service-provider/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Certified Service Provider</a> (CSP) program, we were excited to work with PKP to recertify their ORCID integrations that were built for OJS and OPS to demonstrate a commitment to open research and ORCID’s ongoing mission,” said Shivendra Naidoo, ORCID’s Senior Engagement Lead. “We thank them for their continued support and for participating in this webinar to demonstrate how editors, publishers and institutions who use OJS or OPS can easily configure the ORCID integration, to maximize its benefit to authors and reviewers, as well as the wider research community.”</p>

<p>Below are some of the points of interest brought forward by members of our senior team.</p>

<p>“We don’t really talk about the number of ORCID iD’s anymore because what’s more interesting is how many records are actively being used,” said ORCID Executive Director Chris Shillum. “So we now focus on our active researchers in any one year, which is steadily climbing, and as of now is about 8.2 million. We have those users in every country in the world now.”</p>

<p>“We’ll continue to work on privacy,” said Director of Operations Tommy Tepper, as well as add a new initiative building on work that’s already been done on cybersecurity. We’ll be re-writing the privacy policy that’s available on our site to improve the clarity and transparency. In terms of cybersecurity, we’re going to adopt a framework that will give us a plan of action for years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ORCID and GitHub are delighted to announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) committing the two organizations to coordinate efforts encouraging the adoption of ORCID iDs through the research data lifecycle. <a href="https://github.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, part of Microsoft, is a collaborative platform for creating, hosting, managing, and sharing code, used internationally by programmers, researchers, and tech organizations all over the world and is the world’s largest source code host.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Chris Shillum, Executive Director of ORCID said, “Integration between ORCID and GitHub has been one of the most requested features from our community for a number of years, so we are excited to be able to announce this partnership. Ultimately we hope that our collaboration will allow the huge number of people who contribute to research largely or in part through software development to gain better visibility and claim credit for their work.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Arfon Smith, Product Manager at GitHub added, &#8220;Academics and researchers contribute to some of the most influential open source projects on GitHub. By making it possible for researchers to connect an ORCID iD with their GitHub profile we&#8217;re raising the visibility of these contributions, and making it easier for others to credit them for their work.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-orcid-and-github-will-collaborate">How ORCID and GitHub will collaborate</h2>


<p>Under the MOU, ORCID and GitHub agree to dialogue and cooperation on the following topics:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Building awareness and encouraging researchers to register for and use their ORCID iD throughout the research data lifecycle.</li>



<li>Building awareness and support for GitHub-organized events when ORCID is invited to participate as part of GitHub’s panel of experts.</li>



<li>Sharing of ORCID’s informational and outreach resources with GitHub to help them communicate the value of ORCID to their users and stakeholders to increase adoption.</li>



<li>Building awareness of GitHub’s ORCID-related developments and initiatives to ORCID’s Member Community with relevant blog posts, social media posts, inclusion in ORCID’s Member Connect newsletter, and/or case studies.</li>
</ul>



<p>To support these goals, ORCID and GitHub will work together to develop use cases relevant to our shared stakeholder communities and will explore options for coordinated communications regarding existing and upcoming events.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-github-s-new-orcid-integration">GitHub’s new ORCID integration</h2>


<p>As a first step towards greater collaboration, GitHub has developed an integration with ORCID, which allows GitHub users to link their validated ORCID iD to their public GitHub profile. This will help to uniquely identify researchers using GitHub and connect their GitHub profiles to their scholarly other activities, affiliations, and outputs in their ORCID profiles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-will-researchers-and-orcid-member-organizations-benefit">How will researchers and ORCID member organizations benefit?</h2>


<p>ORCID encourages all researchers who use GitHub to connect their ORCID iDs with their public GitHub profiles using the new integration, and ORCID member organizations to promote awareness of this capability among their researchers. The initial integration allows GitHub users to link and display their ORCID iD on their GitHub profile.</p>



<p>As more researchers take advantage of this capability, we hope to see greater interest from the global research community in a deeper integration between ORCID and GitHub in the future. ORCID and GitHub will engage their respective communities and stakeholder groups on the specific use cases that would define this deeper integration and the data that could be exchanged between the two systems.</p>



<p>If you already have a GitHub account and an ORCID iD, simply sign into <a href="http://github.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/settings/profile</a> to authenticate your ORCID iD.

<p><a href="https://kisti.re.kr/eng/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information</a> (KISTI) is a leading research institute in science and technology information and has been a member of ORCID since 2013, a year after ORCID’s founding. As a leader in open science and technology infrastructure, it has shown a longtime commitment to ORCID’s sustainability in the research ecosystem.</p>



<p>More recently, KISTI has demonstrated a commitment to enhancing interconnected research infrastructure by bridging the international and Korean science communities. One of its sponsored initiatives is integrating ORCID into the Korea DOI Center (KDC), which serves as Korea&#8217;s only DOI registration agency (RA). KDC contributes to enhancing the influence of researchers by promoting permanent access and citation of domestic research content.</p>

<p>In 2023, KDC added the <a href="https://doi.or.kr/service/pageView/126?t=1710337195153" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID Auto-update</a>, which is an ORCID integration meant to better serve its research community by automatically adding the research output information of the relevant DOI to researchers&#8217; ORCID records with researchers’ permissions. At ORCID, we have made sure that researchers are always in control of their records, which includes not only what data gets added to their records and by whom, but the visibility of that data once it&#8217;s in the record. When a DOI is registered with KDC, the ORCID Auto-update function is provided. That is, KDC will let researchers know via their <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ORCID Inbox</a> (accessible once they are logged into their record) when they have publications with their ORCID iD included as a part of the DOI registration metadata. KDC then requests permission from the researcher to add that work to the ORCID record. A researcher’s work will only be added once they have granted the organization permission to do so.</p>



<p>After permissions are granted, whenever a new work associated with the researcher’s ORCID iD is found in KDC’s system, the publication metadata will be automatically flown to the corresponding researcher’s ORCID record.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enter-once-re-use-often">“Enter once, re-use often”</h2>


<p>Auto-updates are just one way that ORCID can save researchers time and reduce administrative burden. ORCID created the slogan Enter once, re-use often to communicate this principle of time and energy saving.</p>



<p>When research outcome information and researcher information are automatically linked, it is easier for researchers to manage research output history, demonstrating transparent and trustworthy connections between researchers, their contributions, (and their affiliations). By doing so, it also promotes visibility of domestic research results to international scientific communities.</p>



<p>But that’s not all. With a more connected research infrastructure, validated information can be further re-used by different systems that integrate with ORCID, which increases trust within the whole research ecosystem.</p>

<p>Researchers in Korea and elsewhere in the region are starting to grant permission to KDC at an increasing rate. IORCID’s database alone currently shows that nearly 72,000 active researcher and contributor records are associated with Korea, which accounts for the 5th largest number across the Asian region. This shows great potential for reaching more interconnectivity in the research ecosystem in Korea through the partnership between KDC and ORCID.</p>



<p>Additionally, Korean publishers are starting to collect authenticated ORCID iDs and make them a part of DOI registration metadata. Widespread adoption of persistent identifiers (PIDs) like ORCID is critical to the success of trustworthy research infrastructure, which promises to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery by facilitating information sharing, reducing inequities in research outputs, and enabling reproducibility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>When a PID-provider such as a DOI registration agency works hand-in-hand with ORCID, the PID-provider for people, it allows for the possibility of greater collaboration amongst researchers, which strengthens research and the overall research community.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Of course, ORCID works with a variety of PID providers, both international or more regionally-focused, in order to create an infrastructure that is able to provide a more trusted, resilient research infrastructure. It is vital that research infrastructure providers work closely together to ensure our products and services work seamlessly.</p>



<p>Now that KDC has integrated with ORCID, the agency will be better able to promote excellent domestic research results globally and serve the entire research community.

<p>After <a href="https://orcidus.lyrasis.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Lyrasis</a> received notice of their funding award, Sheila Rabun said the first thing they did was to map out a timeline and start connecting with partners.</p>



<p>“We created a projected timeline for the next year of the different activities and things that would need to take place to make sure that we can complete the project within the given timeframe,” she said. “I also reached out to other consortia leads, letting them know that if they have organizations in their country that are using DSpace that we are going to be working on this project. And so through that I kind of put together an informal advisory board with other consortia leads so that they can be involved.”</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that we have included <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/csp-criteria-discovery-systems/" data-wpel-link="internal">Discovery Systems</a> to our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/become-an-orcid-certified-service-provider/" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Certified Service Provider (CSP) program</a>! </p>



<p>Certification is a free-of-charge service offered by ORCID for any integration that meets ORCID&#8217;s best practice-based criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the upgraded CSP program, ORCID provides an enhanced set of benefits to CSPs, including greater exposure to potential customers and users who seek reliable, consistent, and convenient solutions. CSPs also enjoy some benefits normally reserved exclusively for ORCID’s member organizations, such as expert consultation for integration project planning, testing resources, and dedicated tech support for troubleshooting—both during and after the certification process.</p>



<div style="color:#32373c;background-color:#00d1b2" class="wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-notice gb-font-size-18 gb-block-notice" data-id="d2b19a"><div class="gb-notice-title" style="color:#fff"><p>Get Certified</p></div><div class="gb-notice-text" style="border-color:#00d1b2">
<p>If your organization is a provider of scholarly services and has an ORCID integration, we encourage you to learn more about the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/become-an-orcid-certified-service-provider/" data-wpel-link="internal">certification process </a>and reach out to us to get started with your certification!</p>
</div></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-csps-are-catalysts-to-global-orcid-adoption">CSPs are catalysts to global ORCID adoption</h2>


<p>Service providers that have pre-built ORCID functionality in their products and services enable hundreds of ORCID members to gain value from their membership in the quickest, simplest way: by providing a means to easily integrate ORCID into their local workflows and systems and provide a more consistent user experience for researchers when they encounter ORCID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It might be no surprise to the reader that our member organizations, when reviewing and selecting new systems to meet their own business needs, frequently ask us which scholarly service providers have the best ORCID-enabled product functionalities.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-orcid-certification-criteria-based-on-best-practices">ORCID certification criteria based on best practices</h2>


<p>What we learned from the early days of certifying service providers is that best practice in integrating with ORCID extends far beyond the basics of collecting ORCID IDs and connecting with ORCID records. In fact, in order to deliver the most value to its users, the optimal ORCID integration in a service is highly workflow specific. The new CSP program offers certification for integrations supporting the following workflows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research Information Systems</li>



<li>Manuscript Submission Systems</li>



<li>Grant/Facility Application Management Systems</li>



<li>Repository Systems&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We drafted the revised certification criteria based on extensive analysis conducted on industry best practices for the most important workflows used by various scholarly service provider systems integrating with ORCID. In March 2023, we issued draft criteria for each of these workflows, inviting vendors, those responsible for reviewing and selecting vendor systems, workflow experts, users, and other interested members of the ORCID community to review and comment on the drafts. We then reviewed and integrated the comments and suggestions into the final criteria documents, which can be found here.</p>



<div style="color:#32373c;background-color:#00d1b2" class="wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-notice gb-font-size-18 gb-block-notice" data-id="a09332"><div class="gb-notice-title" style="color:#fff"><p>Browse ORCID CSPs</p></div><div class="gb-notice-text" style="border-color:#00d1b2">
<p>Whether you are looking for providers of Research Information Systems, Manuscript Submission Systems, Grant/Facility Submission, Repository Systems, and now, Discovery Systems, you can <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/orcid-certified-service-providers-list/" data-wpel-link="internal">browse our list of Certified Service Providers here</a>.</p>
</div></div>



<p>We believe that by providing clear, concise certification criteria via the CSP program, we can help service providers ensure that they are delivering the ORCID integration functionality that their customers expect and require.</p>



<p>If you provide services to the scholarly community which fit into one of the categories above, <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/become-an-orcid-certified-service-provider/" data-wpel-link="internal">we invite you to get certified</a>! It is free of charge and will help you to increase the visibility and trustworthiness of your products and services.</p>

<p>We are pleased to invite you to explore the <a href="https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.25134752.v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">ORCID 2023 Annual Report</a>!</p>



<p>2023 was the second full year of our current strategic plan, <a href="https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.16687207.v1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>From Vision to Value: ORCID’s 2022–2025 Strategic Plan</em></a>, and we’re really starting to see the cumulative effects of the efforts we’ve made toward the four priorities we defined when we published it back in 2021:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increasing Value to Members</li>



<li>Increasing Value to Researchers</li>



<li>Increasing Global Participation</li>



<li>Upholding Trust and Integrity</li>
</ol>



<p>In addition, in 2023 we added a fifth theme:</p>



<p>     5. Improving Staff Experience</p>



<p>The central thesis of ORCID’s current strategic plan is that by building stakeholder commitment to and engagement with ORCID, we will in turn create more value for researchers and members alike and drive further participation by (AND benefit to!) other stakeholders, perpetuating global adoption and reuse of ORCID data across the research ecosystem. To state this more simply, the more fully populated, sufficiently complete ORCID records and integrated systems there are, the more value that all stakeholders can gain from participating in ORCID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We invite you to explore our <a href="https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.25134752.v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Annual Report for 2023</a> and learn more about how we moved closer to our strategic goals, and to celebrate with us how support from our member organizations helped us to build on researcher delight, enable valuable connections, expand our global connections, and continue our maturation as an organization.</p>



<p>There is still time to register for our upcoming <a href="https://info.orcid.org/event/orcid-community-town-hall-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ORCID Community Town Hall</a> on 20 March. We invite you to join us while we share the progress we made in 2023 and give a special preview of our plans for 2024.  As always, there will be plenty of opportunity for you to engage with us: to provide feedback, make suggestions, and ask questions.</p>

<p>The event opened with a two-part session introducing ORCID, DataCite, JaLC, and AXIES. Giving Insights into activities and initiatives of the organizations within the APAC region, it was explained how research institutes in Japan can work with ORCID and DataCite directly or through our national Consortium Leads. Importantly, JaLC has <a href="https://info.orcid.org/the-japan-link-center-introduces-new-orcid-functionality/" data-wpel-link="internal">integrated with ORCID</a> and with DataCite to interconnect their services. JaLC also outlined the <a href="https://researchmap.jp/?lang=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">researchmap</a> system being developed by the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Institute of Informatics</a> that is attempting to tie together information about Japanese researchers (their profile and achievements) through the assignment of PIDs, and to further synchronize publication information with the ORCID Registry.</p>



<p>The afternoon was dedicated to two community-led sessions. The first looked at PID initiatives within Japan and APAC that are supporting Open Science principles. The presenters highlighted what is needed for research outputs to be FAIR and Open, and what is needed in Japan for that to happen. The session began with a scene-setting presentation describing the current PID landscape in Japan. The following two talks then showcased how PID assignment to physical research outputs is elevating them in Open Science in APAC—<a href="https://datacite.org/igsn/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">International Generic Sample Numbers for material samples</a> and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for research instruments. Finally, an update was given on the development of the <a href="https://raid.org" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">RAiD persistent identifier for research projects</a> by the Australian Research Data Commons.</p>



<p>The second community-led session started with an analysis by the <a href="https://jpcoar.repo.nii.ac.jp/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Japan Consortium for Open Access Repositories</a> on the present state of research data publishing in Japan. The session then outlined three real examples of PID implementations embedded within Indian, Japanese, and Slovenian research infrastructures, looking at the practicalities of such implementations: the successes and the challenges.</p>

<p>The event concluded with an open discussion on the topics that had arisen during the day and on potential next steps. These discussions highlighted that a coordinated PID strategy in Japan and a central hub for the Japanese research community will benefit the community to identify and connect researchers, research outputs, and organizations nationally, as well as internationally. Even without a coherent top-down policy, various PID initiatives and adoptions are happening across APAC in terms of both individual-/institutional-level repositories and nationwide platforms, demonstrating the growing interest and awareness of the community. Although the development of researchmap alongside use of the Japanese national <a href="https://www.e-rad.go.jp/en/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">e-Rad Researcher ID</a> is starting to address some of these issues, there are still a number of hurdles that must be overcome for researchers to easily openly share and connect their research outputs while ensuring appropriate attribution and credit.</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes we take for granted lots of things that go on around us as researchers/academics. I learnt more about ORCID, DataCite, and other organisations today than I have all my life.</strong></p>

<p>It was generally agreed that the next generations of researchers in Japan will be the driving force to instil the values of Open Science. The main conclusion by attendees was that a follow-up meeting is needed with young Japanese researchers to fully understand the difficulties they face in navigating the fragmented systems that currently exist, and therefore how such systems might be enhanced to improve interoperability between local/regional and international research infrastructure.</p>

<p>The importance of both PIDs and the connectivity between local and global research infrastructures were also highlighted in the session, Open Science and The FAIR Principles: Why, What, and How, co-convened by the authors with Japanese colleagues on 13 December 2023—Day 3 of <a href="https://ds.rois.ac.jp/article/dsws_2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">DSWS-2023</a>. Over 100 people from around the world joined the session in person and virtually to hear the following six talks with a focus on PID adoption as a way to make science more Open and FAIR, including specific initiatives from ORCID and DataCite.</p>

</ul>



<p>From these case studies, participants learnt the different ways in which countries and communities support Open Science and the FAIR Principles—everything from building local PID registries, national research information management systems, and national data repositories, to developing cross-community frameworks—where PIDs for people (e.g., ORCID iDs), research outputs (e.g., DOIs), and research organizations (e.g., <a href="https://ror.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ROR IDs</a>) are major components of the underlying research infrastructure.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The clear message coming out of the session was that connecting PIDs assigned to different research entities is vital and moves science at both national and international levels toward greater FAIRness and Openness. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Often nationally developed solutions are the catalysts for such Open and FAIR science within countries. However, developing these solutions can be difficult to achieve through grassroots movements alone, and the most successful national approaches are usually both top–down and bottom-up, with national science and technology policy then ensuring the connectivity to global solutions.</p>

<p>Increasing Global Participation is one of ORCID’s four priorities outlined in <em><a href="https://info.orcid.org/2020-2025-strategic-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal">From Vision to Value: ORCID’s 2022–2025 Strategic Plan</a></em>. We believe that ​​the more fully populated, sufficiently complete ORCID records and integrated systems there are, the more value that stakeholders can gain from participating in ORCID, and in everything we do, our goal is to create the conditions to allow this to happen. Our Global Participation Fund (GPF), which is one of the initiatives of our Global Participation Program (GPP), is an important program to drive these outcomes by improving understanding and encouraging uptake of ORCID in under-represented countries in the Global South.</p>



<p>We are proud to share that in less than two years since launching the GPF, ORCID has provided nine grants under two different programs—Community Development and Outreach and Technical Integration. Now ORCID has selected six more recipients. The GPF grants are awarded on a biannual basis in the amount of US$5,000–20,000, with a duration of 12 months.</p>



<p>Grants from the Community Development and Outreach program support local partners in areas currently under-represented at ORCID to build robust Communities of Practice, encouraging adoption of ORCID both by researchers and at the institutional level. These grants can be used to support local outreach activities, training, and tech support resources for the creation and growth of ORCID consortia that serve those regions.</p>



<p>Grants from the Technical Integration program can be used to fund software development to build and update ORCID integrations in open-source systems. This will foster participation in ORCID in currently under-represented regions and support the creation of technical documentation, outreach, and support for resources created through the grants.<br><br>We are happy to announce that GPF grants have been awarded to the following organizations in our third round of awards:</p>

At minimum, the project will correct ORCID-related issues in DSpace to allow users to log in with ORCID despite email addresses set to private in ORCID (with code from DSpaceCRIS), x false error message bugs on the ORCID Authorizations page, display ORCID iDs on work landing pages and indicate unauthenticated ORCID iDs, improve the way that updated works are added to ORCID records, and revoke access tokens when a user chooses to disconnect their ORCID iD from within DSpace.</p>

<p>In 2023, ORCID improved our <a href="https://info.orcid.org/upgraded-certified-service-provider-program-now-available/" data-wpel-link="internal">upgraded Certified Service Provider Program</a> by introducing criteria based on workflows unique to Research Information Systems, Manuscript Submission Systems, Grant/Facility Submission, and Repository Systems. This year, we are adding criteria to certify Discovery Systems.</p>



<p>ORCID is a community-driven organization that strives to work as openly and transparently as possible. So as with last year, we encourage vendors, those responsible for reviewing and selecting vendor systems, workflow experts, and users of discovery systems, as well as other interested members of the ORCID community, to<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCIw40ag4dUxMrU5osuW6WXWxV95RAV9n_y68RHDqic/edit#heading=h.lqm2jpcs08xf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> <strong>review and comment on the draft certification criteria for Discovery Systems</strong></a><strong> until 29 February 2024</strong>.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-certified-service-providers-enable-efficient-orcid-adoption">Certified Service Providers enable efficient ORCID adoption</h2>


<p>Service Providers (SPs) that have pre-built ORCID functionality in their products and services enable hundreds of ORCID members to gain value from their membership in the quickest, simplest way, by providing a means to easily integrate ORCID into their local workflows and systems and provide a more consistent user experience for researchers when they encounter ORCID. Our members frequently ask us which scholarly service providers have the best ORCID-enabled product functionalities when reviewing and selecting new systems to meet their needs. ORCID encourages all providers of scholarly information services to integrate with our Registry AND to become an official ORCID Certified Service Provider (CSP). <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/become-an-orcid-certified-service-provider/" data-wpel-link="internal">Certification is free of charge</a>, and you do not need to be an ORCID member to certify your system.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-welcome-your-feedback">We welcome your feedback!</h2>


<p>We encourage vendors, those responsible for reviewing and selecting vendor systems, workflow experts, and users of discovery systems, as well as other interested members of the ORCID community, to <strong>review and comment on the </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCIw40ag4dUxMrU5osuW6WXWxV95RAV9n_y68RHDqic/edit#heading=h.lqm2jpcs08xf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>draft certification criteria for discovery systems</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The draft will be open for comment until <strong>29 February 2024</strong>. We expect to add this new criteria to our CSP Program in early 2024.</p>
